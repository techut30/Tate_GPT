are men or women easier to fool I think that women fall for what they hear and men fall for what they see and that's why women wear makeup and Men tell lies so it depends who you're trying to fool and why but certainly women are easier to Fool in some regards depending on the tools at your disposal and I can say the same for men I wouldn't say one is easier than the other I think that men and women are quite different we have a different type of intelligence but women certainly have an intellect women can be psychic Sometimes women can just say I know you were cheating and she can have no proof at all and she just knows women can have a type of intellect that I don't think men have so overall I'd say men are easier to fool
