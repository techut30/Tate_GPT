the reason nobody has discipline anymore is because it's not Tau discipline isn't taught and the idea of being disciplined is seen as negative and we also live in a world where everything and everybody is vying for our attention everything there's ads Everywhere YouTube happens quickly kids are being raised with iPads like when I was a kid or you were a kid we had a coloring book now they got flashing lights and little video games like how how do you think you're going to keep his attention as he grows old he's been he's been entertained by some of the best software developers in the world permanently so the second he can pick up an iPad so your attention is very very difficult and that's what discipline is really it's the ability to stay focused on one thing for a long period of time and I think most people don't realize how bad their attention span is or how much discipline they lack until they really start to suffer from it and that's what will happen especially as a man I can't say as a woman because I'm not a woman but as a man if you don't have the ability to knuckle down and focus on something for a long time life's going to punish you sooner or later life's going to wake you up and and the reality of Mastery and the reality of success is that it's not really a glamorous story like how do you become the best poxer in the world you do the same thing over and over for 15 years jab cross jab cross hook like it's boring you know but that's what discipline is so the idea that a lot of people want to be constantly entertained I want to be entertained that's boring well that's why you need discipline people want to be constantly motivated oh I don't feel motivated listen if you're not motivated to go to the gym and that has resulted in you being obese suffering Health adversity so you're now damaged your health on top of that you're less attractive to females on top of that your energy levels are lower if you really need motivation to just lose weight and live a life worth living then there's something wrong with you I I train every single day and I'm never motivated but I'm disciplined I never wake up and think yeah I want to train I've been training my whole life I'm bored of it but it's something that has to be done right so the idea of entertainment the idea of motivation these things are completely detrimental to discipline people come to me all the time and say how do I get motivated I say you don't you get disciplined I don't care if you feel like doing X you must do X or you will stay a loser so do you want to be a loser or do you want to do X there nothing to do with motivation there's a version of you that never sleeps in never skips training never wastes time there's a version of you who never fails it is waiting for you genuinely ask yourself a question you at home if you had done those things for the last 2 years you never skipped a training you never wasted time you never scrolled Tik Tok you never sat aimlessly on the internet typing in garbage never played video games you never wasted time you never skipped training you were training every single day you never slept in you were never lazy there's this version of you imagine the person you would be genuinely imagine what you would look like imagine where you would live imagine the car you would drive imagine how much your woman would would respect you imagine the love you would see in her eyes when she looks at you with adoration like a king imagine your existence that person is waiting for you and the only thing that's stopping you from being that person is your Monumental laziness you can have it the universe is very giving it will give you anything you work for I've never seen somebody try for something with all of their might and not get it the only people who do not have the things they want are the people who do not try for them I've never seen a person wake up and say my only dedication in life is to solve a Rubik's Cube and fail you are not stupid you are not incompetent you are lazy and arrogant it's extremely important you understand that that person is waiting for you and you are declining that version of yourself in the Multiverse in the many different versions of the universe that exist there is a version of you that does those exact things and he is a greater person than you can even fathom you can transform yourself into that guy you can be a top G that's exactly what I did I knew who I was going to have to end up being before I became that person my brother and I are not from Rich families we are not from advantaged Beginnings but knew I had to be a big strong fighting billionaire that's what I knew I had to be discipline is the key to success if you cannot force yourself to do something you don't want to do how are you ever going to put yourself through the suffering required for greatness if you cannot force yourself to train when you do not want to train if you cannot force yourself to work when you don't want to work if you can't force yourself to not log into pornhub or force yourself to eat right how can you possibly ever become a monumentally successful person if you cannot control yourself long enough to do what must be done as opposed to what you feel like doing the only people who get to live their lives based on how they feel are women and children children can cry cuz they feel like crying as can a woman a woman can start an argument because she feels like arguing as can a child a man must do what he is supposed to do regardless irregardless of how he feels that is the key component to masculinity is discipline if you do not have the discipline to dedicate yourself to anything you are going to fail and be crushed by the people who can if you only go to the gym when you feel like going to the gym you're never going to be as strong as the people who go to the gym when they don't feel like going to the gym that is a reality of life so I train every single day I've actually heard from some people saying you over train and I explained to them one I don't believe in rest I'm not you I'm not [ __ ] and I'm not broke like you are Mr fitness trainer standing around the gym teaching people for $50 an hour I don't need to listen to you secondly I don't train because I want to get bigger I train every day because it is difficult to train every day it hurts I don't want to I wake up and I'm busy have other things to do I don't feel like doing it so I force myself to do it 7 days a week 365 days a year so that I know I'm the kind of person who can do what he doesn't want to do what it needs to be done I am that man and is more of a mental exercise than a physical exercise at this point how can you ever out compete me if I can force myself to do the things I don't want to do and you cannot discipline is absolutely essential for success and you need to get very comfortable and very used to the idea of understanding that on your path to Greatness there are going to be long periods of time where you hate what you are doing where you are dissatisfied with the actions you must undertake where you are tired where you are stressed that is why it is difficult that is why most people won't make it if the path was easy everybody would walk it and it would lead nowhere 100 people start the path 99 fall off because it is difficult and the one person who makes it to the end gets the gold if all 100 made it to the end and the gold was divided by 100 it wouldn't even be worth anything the difficulty gives it value the fact that it is difficult to do is the key component into the fact you want it in the first place if it wasn't difficult everyone would have it and you wouldn't want it because no one would respect it it's supposed to be hard life is supposed to be hard you're supposed to think this is terrible you're supposed to suffer and smile through the pain regardless discipline is the key to success in all Realms as a man and if you lack it you stand no chance you can give most people a road map to success you can give them a Ferrar with a full tank of gas and a lot of people still wouldn't make the destination because they would say the drive is too far away quitters they don't have the discipline you can tell them exactly how to do it you can give them the mechanism to get there but they don't have the discipline to complete the drive and end up at the destination that is the majority of Earth this is your competition people who even if they are told what to do and people tell them exactly how to do it and help them do it still quit still fail because they lack discipline even me with my Monumental Powers I can't make a quitter successful it doesn't matter how good I am it doesn't matter how easily I make it for them to succeed it doesn't matter how compendious and concise and Powerful the real world is it doesn't matter how much I text them and motivate them how many emergency meetings I do to try and talk to them and hype them up how much motivation I give them it doesn't matter what I do if they are a quitter guess what they're going to do they're going to quit no matter how simple a map is to read no matter how fast the Ferrari is somewhere along the drive the sun's going to get in their eyes and they're going to sit there and go this is I don't like this this is hard and they're going to quit quitters are the number one type of people that nobody can help if you're a quitter I can't help you life can't help you God himself cannot help a quitter so if you lack discipline you lack the very basic building block to any type of success which exists on the planet by every single which can be measured with science you are going to stay a loser and a failure a lot of people with no money are are are really really arrogant I know a lot of broke people who are very arrogant they'll come along and go I think that's a scam oh do you broy oh broy thinks it's a scam oh tell me again about how my online educational platform the biggest in the world which I've built when I'm flying around on my private jet tell me again about how I'm out here to scam you of your [ __ ] 36 lbs it's dumb cuz they're arrogant and their arrogance is a shield for their laziness people will people will shield laziness with anything no one wants to admit they're lazy so they'll Shield it with disbelief Ah that's a scam or I don't work hard I work smart bollocks more more cover for just anything it takes to say I don't want to work there's very there's not many truly like if you put effort into the Universe I think it's lon's it's Newton's Second Law right equal and opposite force people always say oh I wish I had something to work on you could work hard on anything it can be the most jackass thing you can work hard on I don't know [ __ ] wiling whittling Twigs but if you truly work your ass off it's difficult for it to have a negative impact on your life maybe you'll end up with an Instagram page the best Instagram page on twig widling and and and who knows right my point is that it's very hard to find truly truly negative energy that's directed in a in a in a semi-positive direction it's hard to say I'm working my ass off at X and it's made my life worse people who are poor now they don't get rich soon in the next 10 years years or so they're never going to get rich you're never going to get rich the prices of houses are going to continue to go up prices of land is going to continue to go up inflation is going to continue to happen your wages will not catch up it's going to get harder and harder for the average person to ever stand a chance loing any assets yeah it's now or never it's almost impossible right now how does the average person on average wage buy a house in London right now it's almost impossible already I think in the next 10 years is going to become truly impossible and they're going to use AI to keep the Gap closed and what's interesting about that is well I'm I'm in the rich team I guess uh but what I find most interesting about that is the socio ramifications of the fact that I think this is quite pertinent to most average people I think most normal people understand if you were to ask them how is the economy they'd say well it's impossible I can't pay for my bills I can't pay to eat I can't afford a house I can barely afford my mortgage I'm never going to get rich this way they understand all of this but they're not panicking why are you not panicking the the Titanic just hit the iceberg you may not be in the water yet but it's certainty there's nowhere else to go it's going to sink it's going to happen Panic now don't panic at the end with everyone else as they go into the icy depths no I would argue if I was on the Titanic and it got struck by the iceberg I could have got a life boat nice and early now I wouldn't have Women and Children First I'm just using this as a example analogy know I know where you're going with it I could have gone to the top deck when no one else was pass icking and said you know what I want this I want to go to life vat no I don't feel comfortable go to life vat and the guard probably have said to me you don't need to go to life vat it's no big deal I said yeah but please just give me the Lifeboat or here's some money or whatever I want this one give me this everyone started panicking at the end and there was no life boats and people are sitting here now going oh yeah the economy is bad but you know maybe if we vote for this person who the don't to swear wrong who are you going to vote for that's going to put money in your pocket actually actually come along and say Here's money nobody still got to pay your council tax still a broie nobody cares no one you vote for is going to change it it's going to get worse it's going to continue and you know the boat is going to sink and you're not panicking I've said this before and I'm going to say it again it's the same answer that I gave over and over again a a female the best you can hope for for a female is for to have a nice happy life trauma doesn't really add to the benefit of a female a female doesn't need trauma to grow into a respectable person who can have a nice varied enjoy Life as a man you need to go through trauma you need to go through difficult periods you need to go through things which are extremely uncomfortable to become any kind of man of value every single woman on this panel if you were to ask her to describe the kind of man she wants she would describe a man who she thinks makes her feel safe who is dominating who is smart who is charismatic who is interesting Etc you cannot be all of those things by accident any man who grows up with a very very easy life who never goes through anything who's born with a silver spoon in his mouth is the exact kind of punk [ __ ] these women don't want to touch right as a man you need to suffer and you will survive and you need to internalize it not become a weirdo accept that the trauma is was going to make you strong enough to become the kind of man that's respected by society and you need to use it for your own Advantage every single man out here the man that you're going to love the most has been through the most crap so why women love gangsters he been through a bunch is this he been shot this guy's been shot etc etc etc as a man if you have not been through extremely difficult Pro processes you never going to be a high value man so when you ask me that question the answer is an answer you're not hoping for because likely you've been avoiding trauma your whole life if you weren't already avoiding trauma you wouldn't already be a [ __ ] punk because you can find trauma yourself you can go get in the boxing ring you can go get in the cage you could go to war you could join the Marines you could do a whole bunch of stuff but you don't want to do any of it right and you're hoping I'm G to give you some quick fix there is no quick fix there is no replication there's no way you can falsify on a long enough timeline to convince anybody on any serious level that you are about it unless you're actually [ __ ] about it so the answer is if you want to be a man of Distinction you need to go and suffer that's sure answer I I talk often about the importance of of trauma as a man I think that if you were to find the most interesting or most capable men on the planet they've had the most trauma filled lives I just think that trauma is what teaches you we talked earlier about how you have to have lessons taught to you the hardest way if I were to if you were to call a Navy SEAL and ask him to protect you going into a building full of asants you'd like to think that guy's been through some stuff you'd like to see some scars right lessons and Trauma and the more you go through the better of a man you are and if you were to find the best men on the planet I guarantee they've been through a bunch of terrible things uh and if you listen to podcasts from any of the most interesting people on the planet usually they've been through they've had hard terrible lives and you can use that trauma to become a better person or you can let that trauma consume you and destroy you but I thank God for all of it because it gave me endless power to become the person I am the bad things that are happening to you are what you need to become the man that you want to be [Music] am
