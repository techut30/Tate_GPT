firstly I'll answer can everyone be successful successful is all about self-definition which is what I was saying at the beginning you have to defi decide who you want to be and if you're if you wanted to be Joe Schmo and you pull it off then you'll be a pretty happy content person there's a study I read about [Music] [Music] stress and it was uh saying that stress they uh stress has a placebo effect attached to it cuz the placebo effect is extremely powerful they found some of the most stressed people in the world and they split them into two groups and they're all equally stressed they all have a bunch of cortisol in their blood yeah the people who believed they were that stress was bad for you and that stress can hurt you and they believe those medior articles were dying earlier they were having heart attacks and they having stress related illnesses the people who believe the opposite who just said stress is part of being successful I like stress when I feel stressed I do my best it makes me anxious it turns my brain on I like being stressed lived longer than average the point is the same drug how you look at it and how your body anticipates it how you feel about it affects the real world results which goes back into what you were saying earlier about the jealousy you're saying people look on social media and they get jealous and it demotivates them that's because that's because they decide to be demotivated by it do you know what happens when I get jealous of somebody beat them if I look at somebody has something I ain't got I will take it from them by hook or by crook the whole idea of happiness I think has been misconstrued to the populist especially to men and this is why so many people label themselves as unhappy because they're trying to find that gsh childish happiness they had when they were a child for basically no reason and I don't think it works that way I think as a man the only way going to be happy is if you do [ __ ] you don't want to do you have to make yourself happy by looking at a mountain and going [ __ ] sake and then getting to the top and going thank God that's done there's no other way to do it you're not just going to be happy by default you have to go through pain and if you're not prepared to go through pain you're not going to be happy and it's also the way you label yourself like I I truly am like I said I don't believe in things that take power away from me and people wake up and go I'm not happy today or otherwise I I believe happy can be quite binary instead of at as a scale I think unless you're distraught unless you're genuinely about to cry your eyes out because of loss of a family member or something unless you're distraught which hopefully doesn't happen very often then you're happy you may be slightly less happy than the other day but you're still happy overall like as as long as nothing bad has happened you have to wake up and go okay I'm alive my people around me are alive it's a happy day it's a mindset it's a happy day okay I got stuck in traffic whatever whatever but it's a mindset and and but you're completely right about going through difficult things and obviously as a fighter you know that very well and even now me I could people say to me Andrew why don't you just take your money and just you know just retire and just chill I like I'd be miserable I can't just I can't I need to be I need maybe I'm not fighting in the cage now I'm fighting The Matrix and all the social media compan I can't stop I need something to go against it's just like some men are born that way otherwise why did gasan keep conquering you you need a purpose and and and a purpose is not always going to be you know sunshines and rainbows and and there has to be a degree of difficulty to it and it has to be a degree of of pain involved and there has to be a degree of risk cuz risk and reward are linked fighting is the ultimate risk reward there's risk and reward are linked if you if you're going if you want a huge reward with no risk well then what you going to do you end up playing video games wasting your life there is no such thing as a successful person when I hear people say a it's hard or I don't have time etc etc all you're doing is telling me you're a loser every single winner feels the same as you do the difference is they do not quit they do not give up they do not make excuses they stay on the highway it's amazing what you can achieve if you never give up I don't care about excuses God doesn't care about excuses and the winners who went through the exact same things you're going through who didn't quit don't care about excuses there are winners and losers in the world you are either a winner who dedicates himself never gives up continues to learn does everything he knows he needs to do regardless of how he feels or you're a loser who makes excuses and you stay invisible for the rest of human time make a choice what's the point in having an easy life why would I want an easy life if someone were to say to me do you want an easy life I'd say that sounds Bor I mean did gask Khan want an easy life did Alexander the Great want an easy life did any of the men you can remember from history any of the ones that actually matter ever want an easy life if I meet a man and he says I want an easy life I just want a stress-free life I look at him and think you're born to lose you're born to lose sir you can have your stress-free life and you can serve me my lot say and you go f off because you're you're not made to it life is war and it's going to be stressful and life isn't always war of course it is life is war every single aspect of life is war not losing your temper in traffic on your way to a podcast is war trying to get a girl that the other guy wants is war trying to buy a Ferrari that everybody else can't afford is war training is war fighting is war Life Is War I I see War everywhere when I see a big beautiful oak tree I don't see a big beautiful oak tree I see a tree that destroyed all the saplings around it and crushed them mercilessly it's War Life Is War so that's how I view it I guess the only disadvantage of being so hard on myself cuz I don't see any disadvantages because I have zero self- sympathy I blame myself for absolutely everything even this Matrix attack I want to make it very clear I'm not looking for sympathy on any level I'm not an idiot I ran my mouth on the internet for a very long time I pissed off very important powerful people and they and they put me in a jail cell I sat there in jail like well I'm here for the wrong reasons but all in all the fair enough the universe is giving me you know you run your mouth and you piss people off they're going to try and teach you a lesson that's how the world works like I'm not going to sit there and feel sorry for myself I guess the only disadvantage of being so hard on myself is that I'm extremely hard on others and some people find me difficult to deal with for that reason they'll be like Oh I'm struggling with this I'm like I do not give it has to be done at this time oh yeah but but but I don't care you will lose your job if it's not done at this time that's the bottom line and I guess I can be ruthless but why would I have sympathy for somebody else I don't have for myself if I'm going to be so strict on myself why would I why would I allow sympathy for others if I know I'm going to do it I'm going to hold them to my standard so I guess to a degree I can be I can come across as unempathetic to others I guess but um at least I'm not a hypocrite you know and I also like to believe that because I lead from the front I'm not a armchair General I'm suffering myself so if I'm going to suffer and I'm going to perform and I'm going to get everything I need to do done that I expect absolutely the same from everybody around me or they're not going to be allow me anymore so am I hard on myself yes will that change no life is war life is hard you're supposed to be hard on yourself perhaps most men would benefit from being a lot harder on themselves I think I see a lot of men coming up with a lot of excuses for permanent failure I see it all the time why I can't pay my bills that up okay cool why oh you know cuz it's hard and it's all just sympathy B I don't I don't want to hear it it's garbage it's hard it's hard for everybody and you're going to have to just be harder on yourself and pull it off I think we're here to struggle and to learn I don't think we're here to be happy that's why when we keep going back to the Happy argument I've always found that kind of frustrating and annoying and someone goes oh but I want to be happy why why like I why do you want to sit there and laugh like like you you were happy your entire childhood that's your happy days you're allowed to be happy as a kid it's all over now right you you're a man your responsibilities I think we're here to do important yeah Pro provide protect and we're also here to do important things and important things are going to be difficult and they're going to be hard and you're going to get frustrated but that's what gives you purpose I don't see anyone who's chasing happiness I think that's a very feminine frame I understand why some women just want to be happy I think I don't know the how it feels to be a girl cuz I'm not one but in my experience I know women who just want to be happy Girls Just Want to Have Fun fine but you're a man right and if you're a man then it's absolutely different experience of life I I think we're here to struggle I think we're here to endure pain I think we're here to just see how hard we are to kill I think that going through terrible things and living through them and and coming out the other side is one of the most fantastic things about being human uh I think that it's it's almost like once you understand what life is really about there's no emotion which isn't enjoyable the only emotion that the only emotional state which can be seen as detrimental is feeling nothing at all but if you're sitting at home and you're feeling truly heartbroken at least you're feeling something right and and and I think that's the whole part of Being Human I don't I I think we're here to struggle I think we're here to go through pain that's so I wake up each day and go what can I what can I attack what problem can I solve and and look at history why did gask Khan wake up and want to conquer the whole world why did Napoleon conquer the world why did Alexander the Great conquer the world you just wake up and just say give me this give me I want all of it I need to there's an army there they're really big we're better it's intrinsic you need to go and Conquer that's that's the purpose of life well also there's no light without dark and there's no joy without pain you can't have a rainbow without a little rain exactly and no matter how hard you chase pleasure and happiness there's going to be dips and troughs in between there's going to be come downs and downtrends and you're going to have the justos between that time you were laughing your head off and acting gsh like a child and the time that you feel depressed as such and I think it's much better to just adopt a very disciplined stoic mindset I'm always the same base level of happy regardless if I lost all of my money today I would be the same happy if my net worth quadrupled I'd be the same happiness yeah as long as I alive which is a struggle unfortunately in the current climate but as long as I'm alive and the people I I care about and love are alive and as long as I get as long as God gives me the honor of doing my duties and providing for the people I care about as long as I get to wake up and know that there's a whole bunch of people the world who need me and I get to work hard to please them and do good for society and good for the world yeah then then I'm I'm a vessel of God and I happy I'm happy enough to survive that's that's all I look at it as I don't ever consider how do I feel that doesn't cross my mind I have things to do I have things to do you're too busy to think about I'm too busy I have things to do every single day I have very important things to do and how I feel really is not going to affect how I complete those tasks right and I when I speak to men they say I'm unhappy or I need to be happier I think that's absolutely the wrong frame of life you're a man you have duty you have honor you have things you should be doing regardless of how you feel and the people who are Perma obsessed with happiness or sadness I just think it's the wrong Paradigm to view the the lens of life I think you should get up and do what needs to be done you're distracted and you're self-obsessed when you're sad you're sitting at home me me me me it makes you very selfish you don't care about your community when you're sad you don't care about your country when you're sad you don't care about the injustices of the world when you're sad you don't care about trying to actually go and make the world a better cuz you're too busy thinking about yourself so they want you miserable semi- depressed sad unhappy so that you can sit at home and accept them doing whatever they want to the planet and other people without ever talking or standing up or doing the right thing if you're happy uh and motivated you're going to be far more likely to fight against injustices so the fact that I have mass influence and I can just make people feel better is a threat to them they don't want me to make people feel better they talk about men's mental health and pretend to care but when I come along and genuinely help and and stop people from committing suicide they delete me they don't want that they want everybody semi- depressed they want you miserable they want you distracted so that you're too busy crying your eyes out in a room somewhere or sitting in deep thought worrying about this girl who left you so they can just continue to run the world if I'm unhappy with something and I'm uncomfortable with something I fix it that's endless motivation which I don't truly believe in as a concept but that's endless fuel for the fire if I was unhappy with something about myself regardless of what it was I would be able to to take all of that discomfort and turn it into endless energy to get the problem fixed but these people seem to it's okay to be unhappy yeah well these people seem to sit and say I'm really I'm really unhappy with X but then stay doing X so I don't believe they're truly actually unhappy what you'll notice if you live life long enough is that somebody will sit and say to you I'm unhappy being a loser say why are you a loser I just sit at home play video games s days a week and you're like okay and maybe 3 days of the week they're unhappy doing that and that's the time they email you that's the time they want to make a change but four days of the week they don't really it doesn't really bother them doesn't really bother them cuz if if it bothered them s days a week guess what they would fix it correct so I have very little sympathy for people and that's not because I'm not a nice person but it's because I've been so hard on myself and I've been through so many things that were difficult and I've been through so much pain and Trauma myself some of it self-inflicted some of it given to me by God to make me a better person but I've been I've been so difficult on myself it's very hard for me to look at somebody refused to be difficult on themselves and see them as my equal or feel sympathy or pity for them why would I feel pity for somebody who took the easy route when I took the hardest possible route I took the hardest possible way to be the man I am and you were too big of a and now you want me to feel sorry for you I don't feel sorry for you I don't feel sorry for these people and uh because as a man you can be anything you decide you want to be that's the beauty of being a male you can build your character completely from the ground up just like a video game every single thing about me that people respect I built I was not born a world Champion kickboxer I was not born this intelligent or uh intellectual I was not born this rich I was not born this strong I was not born this confident I was not born this interesting I was not born this charismatic and humble and gorgeous and tall and strong and sexy I was not born none of these things I became these things myself so I deserve all The Spoils of War and anybody who decides they don't want to work hard enough to become those things then they deserve to sit and accept their my inferior that's that's their problem and this is what we're talking about the uncomfortable of being uncomfortable and how it can motivate you when I didn't have have enough money to buy whatever I wanted I couldn't fall asleep at night because I understood there are people out there that did and I didn't see them as better than me and I thought why are these people who I don't see as my Superior living an experience that I can't live and it bothered me to the point where I could not sleep so yeah that was real when you talk about suffering mentally I don't really consider that suffering uh I did I have had a very painful life I still think to a degree I do but that's self-inflicted but I can't imagine living any other way I can't imagine living in this idea this utopian hahaha every day just you know girls drink head in headism I don't want that yeah it's degenerate I'm always I think the only thing you can do that's not degenerate is usually be fighting a battle or solving a problem yeah growth yeah so you need to either fight a battle or solve a problem to avoid degeneracy which means I'm constantly looking for them I'm currently one of the largest battles on you can Poss a man comp possibly take on I'm taking on The Matrix the most powerful people on the planet right yeah so yeah is my life difficult yeah uh am I complaining about that no in fact I'd hate it for for it to be any other way I'm not saying feeling depressed is not real everyone feels depressed I'm saying the idea of depression as something you cannot control is a dangerous idea and Paradigm the reason so many people are committing suicide is because the Matrix is telling you that if you feel depressed you cannot fix it they tell you that depression is a disease that you can catch from the sky no matter how fantastic your life is and you have no control over it and I argue that absolutely the reason the Matrix wants you depressed and sad is because when that happens you are selfish if you're depressed and sad you only care about yourself you don't care about your community or your family you don't care about the world you do not stand up for anything you will accept being [ __ ] in the ass like true Jordy you'll accept any amount of garbage they want to give you any Matrix slave mind programming because you're too busy being sad to resist this is why they tell you that when you are depressed it is a disease it is not a disease you're depressed because your reality is depression depressing the truth is if I lived the reality that most of these depressed people live I'd be depressed your reality is depressing you wake up your wife doesn't love you your kids don't respect you there's no milk in the fridge and you're almost dead of course you're depressed you're running out of time you never had any fun or Adventure energy cannot be destroyed it can only be converted take the depression and turn it into motivation and all of a sudden you'll see how fantastic your life is people the solution to something and they don't like the solution then they'll pretend you're wrong right you you I'm depressed that's why I'm fat no no that's that's not that's you're not fat because because you're depressed you're depressed because you're fat so how about this go to the gym and train oh that's hard well then then stay depressed like what do you want what answer do you want no I want a way to be as fat and unhealthy as possible while also having a perfectly capable mind and feeling fantastic well then you get down the route of just drugging yourself right the the mind is a very sophisticated chemical Factory and your body produces the chemicals what's the complication like why is it hard to work out that if your body is efficient and doing what it's supposed to do and strong and is optimal then your mind is probably going to follow what's there complicated to understand that habits which are beneficial to you are going to allow you to build a more discipline to be a more motivated individual and also change your objective reality people also want to disconnect not only mental health from physical health but they also try and disconnect mental health from objective reality I have it all the time they go oh he's depressed it's not his fault I say listen he's a loser and his life is [ __ ] if I was him I'd be depressed so let's not pretend that his mental health is completely separate to the objective reality of the fact that he is a lonely dork of course he's depressed who wouldn't be if you if he got up and tried his best and was disciplined and was motivated and he was important and actually became somebody guess what he'd start to feel better so you're completely right they have separated from physical health they separated it from spiritual health because also if you know you're doing bad things inside of your heart you're going to feel guilt which is why all the people who absorb the Matrix programming end up being so unhappy but also the the biggest disconnect for me is mental health and physical reality I've sent it to depressed people before I'm depressed I have a disease okay you have a disease describe your life to me they describe their life and say you don't have a disease you have a [ __ ] life that's it you have a [ __ ] life so you don't got disease you're just a [ __ ] loser fix your life you'll feel better no it's not that simple it is that simple my friend because I'll tell you something I'm the happiest man in the planet but if I was you I'd be depressed cuz you're a [ __ ] loser so that's it there that's it you're a [ __ ] loser you're a [ __ ] loser but but I say this stuff and the reason I say it so brutally is because I don't believe the people who are losers didn't decide to be losers if you're a loser you chose to be for the same reason if you're fat you chose to be fat I don't [ __ ] buy any [ __ ] that someone is force feeding me you decided to be I think the universe is a very giving place I think that God is very giving I think that in reality objective reality if you truly try your best you'll get it I've yet to meet somebody maybe you can correct me who eats right goes to the gym every day and trains as hard as they could who is not in fantastic shape I've never seen it it's like so the only people who aren't in fantastic shape are the people who decided not to do those things so they decided so I don't feel sorry for them I'm done having picky with people I'm done [ __ ] sitting there going oh dupd dooo no you decided to be a [ __ ] loser so your life [ __ ] so you're depressed good that's your that's that's what you decided to pull from the Universe I decided to pull the absolute opposite mm [Music] w
