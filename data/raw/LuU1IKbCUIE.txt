are you really a billionaire cuz I think you've turned over billions but I don't think you've got a net worth of a billion how do you calculate that worth the assets minus liability but then let's say your assets are com but a lot of people go oh my company's worth a billion it's actually worth cool correct so then what you can do is you can go online and you can look at previously sold or multipliers multipliers let I had an online educational platform that turned over $150 million a year at 80% profit and then you would say well the standardized Tech multiplier is six well that's a billion dollar company it's not a personal billion dollar Network what's a billion dollar company that's owned by me Tristan has no share in it shares you're sing inside the Matrix no one owns it on paper it just exists if I sold everything I own for the fair price I would have a lot more than bilon
