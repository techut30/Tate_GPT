[Music] I ask God give me the heart of David honestly I'm not patient the devil getting frustrated the weed is making me lazy a generation full of babies honestly I can't take just's a little like uh uh thing that I wanted to say I thought it was just so funny uh I'm talking to Andrew uh via Twitter and I go hey man is there anything you need from the states that I could bring to you you know I'm already coming and he goes AirHeads smiley face now mind you bro learning about who you are and then you sending me AirHeads with a smiley face had me dying bro what is it about AirHeads that you love so much bro they're just the best candy ever you were coming to visit me and you asked and I thought well let me you know request some childhood happiness what do we say only women and children are happy right yeah trying to bring me back uh so they don't kill you they're you have the crack how do you feel about other influencers that walk in the footsteps of you but I feel like Miss or maybe they don't miss I kind of want to like ask you how do you feel about like the Aiden Rosses the sneo zurka all of these people that kind of walk in the realm of where you want like neon is one now like how do you how do you feel about these gentlemen I think they're all different people I don't pay attention to any of them um I know something about I think I mean I don't want to insult anybody I don't want to talk about anybody negatively Zer is a clown I mean dude no no no I'm not I'm not laughing because it's zura thing it just caught me so off guard listen I'm not going to talk [ __ ] about anybody I'm going to be very respectful but [ __ ] that guy okay Z I mean I'm just trying to be honest I I don't I I understand your question but I don't see myself as similar to any of them I think that oh no I never said you're similar I think that they're trying to uh recreate your formula oh it's like the Krabby Patty formul you know how Plankton sitting around be like how do they do it and then they're trying to do it but it's not really working yeah but they lack substance they have no lessons to teach they have no life experience they are clowns and when you're a clown you embarrass yourself for other people's entertainment I mean I don't want to Aiden I know well sneo I know well are you close with Aiden yeah I speak to him Goin but but NE neom or whatever his name is he's a clown and Zer is a clown I don't want to insult them too much but they're they're just children being St being stupid and and I think that as the world devolves into Insanity people are looking for Solutions and answers as I said earlier which I can provide they can't provide that because they don't have the life experience or the intellect or the capability so all they can do is provide cheap entertainment at their own expense when you're a clown you embarrass yourself for other people to laugh yeah and and the Joker effect yeah and and it's it's a completely different subsect but I do feel like there are some people who are trying to follow in my footsteps and imitation is certainly the is flattering it was always going to happen there was always going to be people who are trying to be me but there always one top G so it is what it is they're just highlighting the more um insulting version of you than they are like they're not they're they're they're your your your method is punch here's the knowledge and they're just punching for the clicks yeah and I think there's thousands of people and there's probably thousands of influencers I've not heard of who are probably doing trying to do something similar or to C my formula or say the same kind of things and yeah that's probably who are you closest with you know like social media real is it nelk is it Aiden is it who who who do somebody you relate to and you could fully have a conversation and enjoy yourself you know what's interesting the N guys were super cool and I've met a lot of guys and Aiden was cool met Aiden met sneo but you know actually really interesting I don't talk to anybody I I I've realized this in fact there's a conversation about this inside the War Room a few weeks ago and we're talking about how a lot of influencers cross-pollinate for views and stuff right they like I'll do a show with him and he'll do a show with me and then we'll go to his house we'll do a show there and blah blah podcast is obviously different because it's a podcast show but outside of podcasts I don't meet anyone ever if I I I can get a million views with me and Tristan in our home with an iPhone I don't talk to anybody so I don't have conversations with anyone I don't meet anyone I'm far away I'm in Romania I can't leave I don't really want them to come here I don't want to have to entertain them I'm I'm quite isolationist and my friends are the same friends I had 20 years ago I don't have any new friends I don't talk to any new people I don't know if it's because they're necessarily bad people as such but I just think we're on different paths different missions like I genuinely believe I'm waking up and trying to make myself the most excellent version of myself I have the same standards for the people I love and my children and my family and my women and I have the same standards for my fans I don't want any fan of Andrew Tate to have ever lost in any realm this is the thing that's interesting I see these other influencers right let's say these other influencers some random influencer comes along and he sells some random garbage a crypto and the crypto loses a bunch of money for example I couldn't sleep at night knowing that my fans lost money because of me yeah I couldn't I I don't I don't want money that bad I would rather all of my fans say you know what you can say what you want about Andrew tape but since I listened to him my life has only gotten better nothing bad has happened to me I go to the gym I feel better I feel motivated I feel happier I'm I joined his school it cost $40 it was cheap I'm making money now what's there bad about Andrew Tate every single thing he he told me to do benefited me and I really think I'm on this path to Excellence and when I see all these other influencers and I don't want to say names and I'm not throwing shade and I'm not trying to start internet beef because that's what they're going to try and do to trying to get clicks off my name because they're not relevant without me and I don't give a [ __ ] about any of them just don't name them just yeah all these people what they're doing is the way they're acting doesn't inspire anybody to be brilliant going in the street and yelling like an idiot running around with with half naked girls and being entertaining and doing all this garbage they're doing nobody looks to that and goes I want to be a better man at at all they look at it and they might laugh yeah they might think it's funny it might get views entertaining no substance yeah it's no substance and that's why I think my brand is quite unique because it's very substance driven and the reason my brand is so substance driven is because I've had such a difficult life I wouldn't be able to tell and teach the things I can unless God's put me through so much [ __ ] I've been through a whole bunch of things so I can teach and tell the world look you can do this this way and life will improve you can be this kind of person and your life will be better but I think all these other influencers and whatever else they're doing I think they're largely a part of the problem I would like to think in other nations in other cultures and I don't know but let's look at China which has an insulated internet if they have a brain and I've heard this is true I don't know if it is but they make sure that their algorithms the people who become famous are musicians and mathematicians and Engineers they don't allow their algorithm to promote the idiots because they want the youth to be inspired by people who can do math extremely quickly or play the violin grade yeah that makes sense to me now it is the matric to a degree of course is censorship and is governmental control yeah but we're doing the same thing but promoting the opposite we're promoting Insanity so then you go down the rabbit hole why who what's the end goal why do we want children to to wake up go on their phone and tune into a stream of some geek loser screaming at the top of his voice in public who is doing this why are we trying to dumb down the population and permanently distract them with absolute garbage because I I truly believe that is you you talk about God and we talk about faith to be a disciplined religious person the word is discipline it requires discipline it takes discipline to read the Bible it's not going to be screaming kids it's not going to be flashing images it's not going to be as entertaining as a stream with 30 naked girls no you're going to have to sit down pay attention read Focus reflect try and find the lesson in the parable get confused read it again ask for help you're going to have to study that takes discipline as we're destroying the new generation and removing their ability to focus on anything removing their ability to be disciplined you're taking them from God most of the these children today are so messed up from Tik Tok they can't even focus on one page of a book any book cuz all they do a scroll have you ever seen someone on Tik Tok how fast they change video yeah their minds are gone you can't even sit them down and teach them anything whose fault is that hear me out is it the Matrix fault or is it the parents fault well very interesting and I do think that parents certainly have a huge part to play before it was the before it was the sorry interruptor but before it was this right before it was the phone say it was the school system yeah there was two types of parents the one that dropped off the kids went met the parents uh met the teachers met the principal saw what's going on put their toe in the water felt Alam to leaving their child there yep and the other one was like see you later bye yeah yeah true so is this just a different version of where we've been is there a matrix or is there just laziness I don't think there's necessarily a matrix but then you have to look yourself and asked the question if a government's going to come along and say to a social media company your social media product is designed to get people addicted and as a responsible company not responsible competitive company you're developing your product to be as ruthless as possible because that's what you're going to do yeah but we don't want you to say x y and Zed you're not allowed to promote racism you're not allowed to promote hate speech you're not allowed to promote misogyny we do want you to promote transgender ideals we do want you promote gender fluidity we do want you to promote um whatever else and never have a conversation about the fact that maybe we want you to promote discipline and hard work and and these other things that's opposed to being a clown do why because they are they are using these machines to promote garbage why don't they use it to promote anything constructive so check this out we are in the land of the free H you don't agree with this of course not but let's debate about this is it free so free that it's giving the will to anybody to do what they want and this is what the mass wants to do with it first things first no country on earth is free not one next which country has the most people in prison currently America which country has the highest percentage of its population in prison in history America which country has the most laws I don't know that one America so when you talk about the land of the free what they're actually saying is we've built a society based on freedom of course there is no freedom because true freedom is anarchy so I'm not been advocating for it but that's what I'm saying do you think turned that way because of that no no no but here's here's the here's the scop yeah every single country has its own version of their restrictions and rules when I go to the UAE I feel very free because I can say anything I want I don't want to say the things that would land me in jail if I insulted Islam or insulted the leaders of Dubai in Dubai I'd go to jail but I don't want to it doesn't cross my my mind so I speak and feel free in America if you go to America and you talk Pro LGBT Pro agenda pro Democrat Pro all these things you think you're in a free country because you're saying all the things you're allowed to say if you start saying the things you're not allowed to say you'll learn that it's no more free than Saudi it's just there's a different set of rules of what you're allowed to say so what we have please me please me make let me make this point pertinently clear your ability to speak freely is direct directly correlated to your insignificance when nobody listens to you you can say what you want if you get a platform and start talking you will learn very quickly how you're not allowed to say what you want because people are listening you're free to talk in an empty room you're not free to talk to millions of people who are paying attention to you so what we have now in the west is a society which is only linked and only Bound by this false idea of freedom because we don't no longer believe in a flag you look at at Russia all Russians respect Russia they all respect the Russian flag they respect the Russian identity you can be Christian you can be Muslim but we are Russians and when they're attacked externally they unify as a Russian people America doesn't have that half America hates the flag we they they've turned the colors against each other they've turned the religions against each other they've turned the political parties against each other nothing unifies nothing un divided it falls yeah house is divided at Falls nothing unifies America besides the illusion of freedom so when you have the most controlled Nation on Earth with the most laws and the most people in jail and the only thing that's preventing absolute Anarchy and unifying the people is the illusion of Freedom how do you do that what you do is you make sure that nobody's free to do anything important like speak about important issues but you allow people to be free to do dumb [ __ ] so you allow them to be as free as they want to chop their dick off change their name change their pronouns and be clowns so then you could say we're a free Nation look how stupid this idiot gets to act and you sit and say well I don't want to do that I want to talk about the educational system and I have a large podcast and everyone's listening to me delete him ban him whoa whoa whoa whoa First Amendment no no ban him oh he's still talking oh there's demonstrations jail I thought we're in a free country oh you are free you could chop your dick off but I don't want to do that so the whole thing is a scam and only the Western countries even promote this idea of freedom and it's a scam Freedom as I've just described whereas other nations don't do that Saudi Arabia will not say we are a free country they will say we are God-fearing we are Islamic country we don't care about Freedom we care about worshipping God and living true to God now I actually as a person like the rules I understand even if I were to play a game I don't particularly like right even if I was in a situation even if I don't like the rules of life let's say you made me move to some random country quala Lumar I don't know the rules of qual lmar but I have to move there I even know what that is yeah but I have to move there and you give me the set of rules rules and I read them I'll respect that what I don't respect is going to a country and reading the rules First Amendment freedom I'm like oh cool and it's and then they and they get you it's a mirage it's a mirage so at least in other nations you know the rules you wouldn't go to Moscow walking around with a [ __ ] Putin to you sure no no what see you know the rules yeah so that's the biggest illusion that's going on so when you're talking about we have so much Freedom absolutely and artly not sir I will disagree with you on that point there's no Freedom at all in fact there's less Freedom there is another place and you don't even know what you're free to do anymore depending you can Riot if you're BLM but if you're the if you're the Republicans and you Riot oo jail well I thought we could peacefully demonstr I thought we could demonstrate I thought we could protest it's a democratic company country right no you can't protest anymore there's protest in France are all getting locked up it's it's all a mirage it's all garbage what is now unifying the West because we don't even have God anymore and this is one of the things that's interesting when you talk about Christian versus Islam ironic how everything started coming about when we did take God out of it completely but now we have Christian nations and they don't feel Christian to me they don't look Christian I mean I could walk around with a [ __ ] Jesus t-shirt in a Christian Nation I wouldn't do the same thing with an is in an Islamic Nation with the Islamic prophet and I respect I wouldn't I wouldn't do it with an Islamic prophet in a Christian Nation you're still toast yeah so they won't put up with it they won't put up with it so that's the thing that's so interesting when you start to analyze people who are atheistic and go go stupid you don't need God they not even smart enough to look at the big picture and realize without God there's nothing yeah you have nothing but Anarchy and chaos and I tell you when 10 armed men turn up at your house and start raping your wife and putting a gun to your head you wish God was there you'll be praying then Mr atheist Mr [ __ ] tough guy then you'll start talking about God and it could have been prevented in the first place if Society was preserved if there weren't [ __ ] atheists like you talking Godless that's what these clowns don't even understand without God there's nothing it's all a joke it it's so it's perfect that you say that because every man knows God when he's at his lowest place oh they were they were praying on that submarine woo they got the candles out they had the little picture of Jesus like who's got a picture of Jesus anyone got a picture of Jesus a [ __ ] oh my that was so you catch me with the left bro you catch me sometimes they were praying um sir I forgot oh oh here it is here it is that was great uh I think we're this is the thing that people don't understand and and mind you this is just me for reflecting tell me I'm wrong I want you to tell me if I'm wrong I believe every man woman baby CH anybody were all designed to worship yep all of them y now you could say I don't believe in God buddy that's your faith y you don't believe Y in God that's your faith so you worship it you don't worship a God but you worship yourself Y and I think that's why they they feel the weight of the world on them because God's like all right you don't want me to have it in my hands have it in yours yeah good luck yeah and it comes crumbling down and then you start realizing that even your family could get evil and then you could get evil and your loved one can get evil but then when you have boundaries and restrictions and rules and here's the best part I think wisdom truly is starts and finishes with the fear of God absolutely same way if you have the fear of your father you respect your father right AB you fear of disappoin absolutely no and it's so important what you've just said because it's so profound and people at home need to understand it all humans are meant to worship and this is true the Godless atheistic left-wing psychos worship the pride flag and abortion watch them look at them they worship it they go they turn up they scream its name they try and promote it they worship it or you have famous men who will worship fame or worship their girlfriend worship their wife if you believe in God you're not going to worship your wife you're going to respect your wife you're going to do your very best to do good by her but you're you respect you worship God you're not going to allow a woman to trounce all over you you're like no sorry we live Godless we live within certain boundaries within this house and we're a religious household and you're not going to do that otherwise we're not going to be together anymore this is how it works we're a religious household yep but everybody worships something yeah you by talking about being an atheist you think you're just showing the world how smart you are and that nothing's above you but it's absolutely notely the opposite now you're showing that dumb shits above you you're worshiping Fame you're worshiping uh clicks likes money some other person some human it's garbage it's crazy to me that um and like again I I I talk about only fans uh girls and and I and no disrespect to them and the reason why I have no disrespect to them is because I believe that I was blessed with a with a home that teaches me about making decisions for my future and I can't point my finger at a at a female or a man who's making decisions that they didn't have loved ones to tell them like hey don't just plan for right now we got a plan for your future um everything starts in the home yep and if you notice 90 or some crazy percent of people that are in prison they don't have a father yeah and there's a lot of situations that stem from not having a good example in your life agreed so let's Circle back to the home right we can't we can't control the government we can't control the Matrix we can't control the schools but we can control what goes ins inside and outside of this home that's a very powerful powerful powerful thing that people are not circling around but only if the man is the man of the house yes only if he is not feminized only if the Matrix has not empowered the woman to the point where she thinks she's too good to listen to the man she's supposed to hey guys just a reminder that the merch is out for a few more days so if you haven't got a chance to go to the heartof david. go ahead and click the link in my description or you could shop on YouTube thank you guys so much and I hope you guys enjoy the rest of the podcast what is the foundation of a strong house well it's got be the man and but it's the family unit men and women are different and they're supposed to work together and do different roles to come together and combine and become the most powerful force if you destroy the roles if they no longer combine if they no longer fit together everything's broken which is what's happened in the west now I actually find it fascinating and that's why I'm called called a misogynist by the way I'm called a misogynist for saying there should be a man of the house because they're mistaking leadership with higher value they're they're mistaking leadership with detriment and they're mistaking leadership with oppression and it's it's such a scop that they're doing because they're coming along as s to women any man who says he's responsible for you and tries to guide you is oppressing you and that's absolutely not the case in fact if you look at history most of the time it was the father who guided the the daughter until the daughter got married and then her husband guided her that's how it's always been there's nothing wrong with that and women come along and say we don't need no men's guidance we'll make our own decisions okay that's fine well let's look at the let's look at the decisions you're making let's actually look at Western society and let's look at these women without fathers and let's look at these women who don't listen to no man what decisions are they making are they good for them are they good for society are they good for anybody I said something that got me in a lot of trouble a long time ago and I'm G say it again I said please I'm not good at learning my lessons what did I say about driving until you hit the tree what did I say okay go ahead I said the world would be a much better place if women had to walk around with their body counts on their foreheads oh I remember you got smoked for everyone lost their minds but not because they're like he's a misogynist because they're too stupid to extrapolate because I say something abrasively to shock people and the intelligent ones will look at what I say and extrapolate the lessons from it like we talk about the Bible you read the parable but you have to sit down and analyze what it actually mean I'm talk female promiscuity women to be moreful Andel with who they slept with this would INSP mascul Excellence now you can't be a loser with a little bit of weed and get a chick over the house you have to be a better version of a man you have to be the kind of man who can provide for her if she gets pregnant for to even consider sleeping with you because that number is going to go up and she's going to be judged for it and women don't like being judged women are very very susceptible to societal pressure and peer pressure and judging same with men same with men but women even more because men are not going to want to be with a girl who has 468 number 100% so now men are going to get men are like I want a low number she doesn't want to add to her number I better be better I better be better now when someone gets together they're going to stay together they don't want to mess up their numbers right they're going to stay together they're going to stay together as a family they're going to be more prepared to sit talk through things work things out no longer divorce anymore the church holds this Islam holds this absolutely because in Islam and in Christianity when you go to church or you go to the temple right what are the main thing that they fear is God but they also fear how other people are looking at them 100% when my mom used to come to church go hey don't embarrass me around these people so I had to behave about all right I don't want to represent my family the wrong way completely peer pressure can go positively as well as negatively so when I said this I got attacked vom misologist but no one understood what I'm actually talking about is couples coming together working together masculine excellence and removing promiscuity from society so that you get to a point where a lot of problems are fixed what did you just say about prisons and fatherless homes wouldn't having that number on a woman's head fixed the fatherless homes now we fixed the prison population you can extrapolate this out towards fixing the entire Society but I make the point and nobody listens to what I say they just they just lose their minds because they're emotional but it's no but it is but but it's amazing how you can extract out from that one point I made but you could have made the same point in a loving way I could have that's what I'm saying bro so then we have to ask why I don't yeah that's the thing bro because I think that's your next Journey because I think you're I think this is what happened you knew step one was to get famous and the only way to get famous is to piss people off I did pretty good you did you did hey you did a fantastic job thank you sir okay your next season now is to group in the rest of the sheep yeah of course and and I think and I say sheep in a good way trust me it's a biblical term uh I think right now you need to win the hearts of some females that disregard you completely because I had this conversation with my girlfriend and my girlfriend's like Hey listen he says this he says that I go okay you got to think about what they're going so we had to sit down and watch a podcast and they like baby's trolling here and she goes well I don't understand that he's trolling here why would he be trolling here why is he talking so serious here yeah but then he's joking around here of course so I think honest to God I really do I think your next journey is going to even be bigger because now you're going to have to figure out a way to talk to other people without pissing them off and I can and I can do it for this episode explain to me in a way that you get the same result of the numbers thing like school without using the numbers thing what what could we do to get women to use their numbers lower without disrespecting them and saying hey go outside and and put your number up of course and just the point I'll make I don't think it's disrespectful I think it was just a thought experiment but I understand what you're saying I can say it in a far easier way do you know why I'm doing this by the way of because I I I want to vouch for you and I want to vouch for Trump and I want to vouch for people that I do believe in but it's really [ __ ] hard when you're going around saying these [ __ ] need to have [ __ ] numbers on their head and I'm like [ __ ] D stop saying that you know what I mean like I'm trying to vouch for you so if I have to come out here and and literally come out fly out here 15 something 16 hours I want to sit here and say dude I am with you but I'm trying to be with you waving my morals and my Integrity I'm trying to bring in even the people that we think are stupid they're still worth saving oh completely understand and I and I'm also very prepared and aware that I can say things in a far nicer way I I agree with you it's not accidental I am aware of it you already achieved what you needed to achieve yeah and and that's why I said it's something I said a long time ago but I was just explaining the point behind it a strong message so how do we get that message out without pissing them off oh that's easy I mean I think when you tell a woman but you know what it's interesting it's really interesting and I want to make this point there is a very vocal minority especially on on the internet of feminists and leftwing psychos I'm telling you if I say to a woman being promiscuous is disgusting 95% of women go yes it's only these 5% of idiots you see going I can do whatever I want I'll sleep with a hundred guys if I want and then we sit and go all women think that way women are not actually as broken as Society is showing them to be on the internet thank God they're not that bad because trust me most women know that in fact women know that so intrinsically in their hearts if you see a woman insult another woman what does she call her a [ __ ] slag it's the first word out of her mouth you [ __ ] it's the first thing women do because women know that's how you insult a woman so even the bad women who run around having arguments with other women who are promiscuous themselves use promiscuity as an in so most of the world actually understands this it's only the Western World which has this very broken vocal minority and these people always come to terms and learn that they were wrong as they were older it's just unfortunate they have to learn the hardest possible way I don't think there's any woman out there except with 100 guys who's happy she's done it it's sad she got scoped by Society she probably had no dad at home no masculine role model no one guided her she got scoped by Society into thinking that having sex with men is somehow going to be empowering and she's woke up one day and looked in the mirror and she hates herself I was at a I feel sad for her I was at a party once at my friend's house and they always make fun of me for this but I was a very uh uh learning curve for me yep I'm sitting there and all my friends are having fun and I'm noticing that this girl's behavior is trying to impress the men that's around her yeah and she starts trying to do drugs and I looked at her and I go sweetheart and by the way that's dangerous right calling a girl sweetheart now is very dangerous and and it never come like my father I have to tell him chill because be like sweetheart honey and I'm like yo yo chill you can't say that [ __ ] no more and it's so heartbreaking cuz my father looks at them like their daughter yeah you know and and so just know if I did say sweetheart I was looking at it from the eyes of my own father so I go sweetheart you don't have to do that yeah and she lost her [ __ ] mind on me and she started freaking out everybody's like y you can't say that blah blah blah is and that right okay she freaks out leaves and she says something that broke my heart the man was like listen you got to go you're freaking out you're causing a problem they're not going to kick me out right they're not going to kick me out yeah but they're going to kick her out and the thing she says she goes no no no it's fine I'll suck your so right there I realized that she was put in positions to realize that that's her way out y That's Her value she can offer broke me okay the next day I asked the gentleman I go hey man what happened to that girl he goes dude I'm going to be honest with you I haven't heard from her and I'm trying to hear from her I'm freaking out so my heart drops I go hey if that girl killed herself I'm going to really really it's going to take me a lot to get out of that because I'm going to know that that weight was on me and then I start going back should I pulled her aside should I done this is and that finds out she put herself in rehab it took one person wow to question wow what she was doing y for her to question Y what she was doing yep if you feel like somebody you love or your neighbor is doing something that you know in your heart hey man like you don't need to be doing that we we've been put in positions to be like don't be that guy y but be that guy because you have no idea how catastrophic her life could go off on if you just asked her one [ __ ] question that's right hey man what are you doing yep you don't need to do that peer pressure can work positively also that's why I circled back to that and it's actually very interesting because when somebody knows you're right and they know they have a problem or they know they've been wrong they usually react with with anger that's why she got so angry cuz she knew you were right she was Defensive she was Defensive I realized that the wom do that the most I do that the most and by the way I'm a very feminine guy I know that I grew up with like a sister I have a lot of girls around me during Co I was locked up with six girls I thought that was the coolest thing in the world turns out so sensitive afterwards everything was hurting my feelings everything you are who you hang out with bro you how many times i' be like how dare you and then I was like all right I need to chill the [ __ ] out you know what I mean like like I I I always wanted to conversate about [ __ ] like how do you [ __ ] feel about like and like you I realized maybe his feelings don't matter and I need to move the [ __ ] on uh but I find that really funny uh okay so we Circle back to the leader of the house okay what else is the foundation of a good home how can a man who doesn't have a father who's made mistakes who who hears your voices now you move the anger can now properly understand the language of love that you're coming from a loving place he understands what's his first step well I believe in actionables in fact actionables is probably the word I type the most on my phone actionable yeah may maybe if I press a actionable comes up because when someone tells me anything my answer is actionable so they come along and they say Andrew the is attacking you they're deciding they're going to print a new story saying you've done XY Z and you're going to be accused of XYZ I don't like oh my God that's terrible why would they do that pointless completely actionable what do we do about it what can we do about it if nothing can be done then let's just put it in the this is going to happen bank and let's consider it for future moves and let's stop talking about it if something can be done what can be done who's going to do it how long is it going to take all I care about is actionables so when I talk to people at home I have all these young guys I get thousands of emails a day thousands of DMS a day people go to my website cake.com they message the live chat all day every day looking for help how do I sit and try and explain the very nuanced and complicated subjects of life and masculinity to 16-year-olds who I've never met in a nation that might be completely different to mine geographically politically and socially and I believe you do that by giving them actionables giving them things you can do so I sit here and I say and when I preach the things I preach I want be people to understand why I've chosen them I don't think anyone's life will get worse if they train hard and get stronger I don't see how your life can detriment from that maybe maybe you could find some extreme scenario but as a general rule to everybody go gym you're a weakling go get strong yes I think that's a good General Point same thing so first is to fix your temple first point absolutely the first point is to improve your body that's the first thing you can do so when you're asking me the man who has no father and he wants to live a good righteous life inside of his home I don't don't know all of his background I don't know his capabilities I don't know his mental state I don't know where he lives I don't know anything but I know that if he gets stronger he'll stand a better chance of doing it because you also learn mental discipline by doing that which is also a good thing to learn when I teach people saying listen you need to go become as rich as possible the reason I'm doing that is not just so that you make money which is the time and energy of other people it's also all the lessons you'll learn along the way you're going to learn how to manage people manage staff manage stress you're gonna learn how to talk confidently and go to meetings you're going to learn how to be organized and on time you're learn how to be punctual you learn a bunch of things if you learn how to make money so I say you need to go get as much money as possible and become as strong as possible because I believe if you do those two things and start to succeed in them you can extrapolate and take all of the lessons from those two things and apply it to anything including a relationship it takes discipline for a relationship takes commitment for a relationship Tak people go lazy when they get a relationship absolutely so if you're a disciplined person who always goes to the gym if you're good at managing stress and controlling your temper from high pressure business meetings both of those things will apply to your relationship and make you better at running a household 100% so that's why I teach the two things I core teach I in fact I teach three things but I teach well even the body just a circle back uh you have muscles like you see that did you ever feel pain from growing those muscles absolutely it hurts so that's also a factor of it and I agree with you I think a lot of people uh that feel like that that once they take themselves from I feel like [ __ ] to like oh I so [ __ ] great they realize they could put that energy other places yeah so I agree with you yep and the third thing I teach which I think is extremely important in lacking in the world today is Brotherhood I think that men have always kept men accountable you just talked about living in a house with six women and how it changed you imagine you lived with six Warriors destroyed me imagine you lived with six men who were training for UFC fights imagine the dude dude no so this happened I swear to you this happened I was I told God I go God I I reflected this is a problem randomly one of my friends from Chicago this [ __ ] is Deep In the Ghetto of Chicago so when I mean a man like you look at he's 65 you look at him the wrong way he'll eat you yeah the energy he has is I'm going to get it done my word's my word yeah and I'm going to be at the gym at this time and be there blah blah okay he came in the gym guess what I can't miss gym no more that's right why what the [ __ ] wrong with you that's right I was up at 600 you slept until 1200 you can't go to the [ __ ] gym and now I'm sitting here being like yeah he's [ __ ] right I probably should be in the gym so it does push me it it it it keep you know what we need we need um I I love uh when when I play I'm sorry I'm losing the word but when uh competitiveness I love being competitive absolutely masculine accountability and you know what else is is with men because men are different than women you talked about how you lived with women they were all talking about feelings Etc you know what's a fantastic motivator for men shame I'm telling you now it works shame if I if I'm around my house and someone was getting fat and all of us to go you're a fat [ __ ] what you eating that for I guarantee they'd train shame works with men and you talk about this and this is the reason I promote Brotherhood the reason I am the man I am is not just because I'm so fantastic it's because I even now to this day live with six men I live with my fight coach I live with my brother I live with some my old friends have had for 20 years we live in this big ass compound this huge house if I wake up and my brother's been training an hour and a half I feel so annoyed and angry and guilty that I have to go and beat him now so that competitiveness Keeps Us constantly at Edge people say me and Tristan me and Tristan are best friends and our Brotherhood is fantastic but it is based on competitiveness but we don't compete against each other we compete to prove to each other we're a good teammate in the battle against the Matrix how do you get there how because I've seen a lot of men get torn up by that yeah so how do you how do you get to a healthy way where we're competitive but it's not going to destroy our relationship well you have to understand that there's enough outside enemies you have to put your ego aside and say look there's enough people who already want me dead we're the same blood can't we at least unite against all the people who want me dead I want you I'm in competition with You Tristan I want you I want to beat you to prove to you I'm a fantastic teammate to you as opposed to I want to beat you because I don't like you and it's a different mentality and we'll sit there and my brother and I are in constant endless competition but it keeps us sharp so masculine competition is super important which is why it's the third thing I teach which is Brotherhood you are the some of the Five People You spend the most time with if you find some guys who have their game right your game's going to get straight it's as simple as that and I think if you take any man on the planet in any situation in any scenario and you tell him to become as strong as possible because of all the lessons he's going to learn become as rich as possible because of all the lessons he going to learn plus obviously being strong and Rich are benefits plus find a network of Brotherhood of men who are accountable to themselves and by extension accountable to you if you're accountable to yourself as a man you're also accountable for your friends I don't want loser friends I don't want [ __ ] friends if I had a guy I really liked and you start being a [ __ ] I'd try very hard to fix him and if I couldn't fix him I wouldn't be his friend anymore I'd say stop that we don't do that why are you doing that what are you crying about again why are you acting that way come on let's go train I don't want to train but we always train come on let's go and then after a while I'd be like he doesn't train anymore get him out bye go go go get eaten by Wolves that's the unfortunate reality of the world because I'm the some of the five people I spend the most time with I don't want to wake up one day feeling terrible and going ah but he's missing the day and I might miss today he'll his poison will get in my brain I have to resist it so if you get a Brotherhood masculine Brotherhood and you're accountable for yourself and for them you're going to be able to do nearly anything I've conquered the whole world with those three things all I do is train as hard as possible try and make as much money as possible and I have men around me doing the same thing you train every day every single day seven days a week you don't give yourself a rest zero don't believe in rest I rest expain I rest when I'm asleep I rest when I'm sleeping okay you explained it thank you you go so [ __ ] quick I didn't like he's sharp dude he do

that's over do you wake up early or no not really I wake up I I 91 I stay awake till like 3:00 or 4: I don't sleep that much cuz I sleep I sleep very late I'm going to I'm going to be vulnerable I'm going I'm going to give you my problems and see like just beat me to death with them and figure out all right let me sit up straight okay um I I took on accountability right for those other things that I was dealing with made me gain weight depressed couldn't uh I had a problem saying no and I had a problem walking away from people that I love y handled that right now there's this thing on my table it's called marijuana okay okay uh I'm addicted I have an addictive personality but I use it to my advantage because if I'm addicted to something and nobody else could tell I've never had a problem with it because I've never had something that was bad for me because everything that I've ever wanted was good for me and that's good to carry me through those days that I don't want to do it cuz I'm addicted to it I'm just like hammering it out um marijuana for me is my brain cuz my brain just goes off so at night I like to unwind and smoke a little bit um I'm scared that it took over my life where I can't even like if I go one day without it I have gone a few days without it because I can't even smoke here and it doesn't affect me anymore that way but I it's my dad said this he goes you have a problem with moderation should I just give it up completely marijuana completely just go through the [ __ ] of it get rid of it or should I teach myself moderation with it well then I also don't have any like I don't drink I don't go to clubs I never even like going to clubs when I was single it just doesn't entertain me I don't have like an outlet I don't even smoke cigars but I'm opening up a cigar lounge with my dad in Arizona Shout Out 24 Street a cigar lounge that's actually pretty cool but I don't even [ __ ] smoke I did it to honor my Dad it's me and my dad's thing okay smoking is the only thing where I can hang back and just [ __ ] chill dude should I feel guilty about this should I get rid of it how do you feel about it it's an interesting question but then you have to analyze what you're doing it for because even the reason you just described to me would put me off doing it because we're obviously different people but you said it stops your brain working at a th miles an hour yeah that's a that's a gift why would you want to turn your brain off think of all the thoughts you haven't had think of all the things you could you haven't done that you could have done why do you want to relax and chill so badly why don't you want your brain working on Optimum efficiency all the time why don't you read the dictionary learn another language why don't you start another business why do you want to chill I I that's the first thing you don't chill dude never so that's the first thing you have to do is analyze [ __ ] first thing you analyze is you don't chill before bed never what do you do before bed I'm working to the second I fall asleep no shot no I'm like I'm like one of those toddlers Who falls asleep halfway through I just I don't I don't think oh it's late I better sleep no if I'm awake I'm awake until I'm like I really can't stay awake and then I'll fall asleep and I I and a cigar doesn't doesn't affect you that way no I can smoke to the second I go to bed and I'm just instantly out I mean a cigar I I don't smoke cigars I actually smoke cigars because nicotine is good for your testosterone level and I do not take steroids that's why I smoke nicotine is good for your testosterone correct that's why I smoke a lot of cigars so I smoke a lot of cigars and do a lot of cardio so that my lungs why don't you do steroids I don't do steroids cuz I've never done them in myti life I was drug tested throughout my whole career and I'm now 36 and I don't do them and my testosterone level is still huge it's still very high it's that absolute upper limit of of the natural you just don't need it so I don't need it but if you needed it would you be Pro for it or not I mean maybe if I get old old which is testerone testosterone replacement therapy but I don't I've never taken drugs and I don't like people who take steroids and I'll tell you why it annoys me because I look like a much bigger monster if everyone else wasn't on steroids it'd be cooler it pisses me off I've done it the hard way and they're all just juicing so so I don't take steroids but you've never smoked weed no never tried a drug in my life and is that cuz you're scared of it because you have an addictive personality or like is it because if I try cocaine and I don't like it I'll regret trying it if I try cocaine and I do like it I'll start doing cocaine and I'll regret trying it damn so why my man reflected on that so why do cocaine so never tried cocaine I've never tried weed never tried a pill never tried ecstasy never take a I've never tried anything besides uh I've drinken alcohol and I smoke cigars that's it but so your your alcohol is like my marijuana then I quit alcohol a year and a half ago so what the [ __ ] how would you even bring it up I got so excited I used to I used I used to drink alcohol and I haven't drinken alcohol when did you drink though when you're unwinding no I used to drink because uh a year and a half ago I quit alcohol cold turkey instantly were you like a drunk or were you just like absolutely not I was extremely effective it was at the time when I was most famous I was doing elk boys I was drinking alcohol when I had all those things on Tik Tok when I first blew up everything I used to drink alcohol all the time and I used to probably drink every day cuz I have a lot of money and I have a fun life and we jump on the jet we drink vodka and we get off and be all these girls we go to the club we drink Vodka you just drink I didn't never had a problem with it never suffered with it never got out shape from it it was fine and then I decided I'm going to live many different versions of reality and I spent a year now partying basically every day and it's been great but I want to live a sober life and see what happens so I just instantly quit I blinked and cured my brain I could quit smoking instantly if I decided I could blink and cure my brain I could just do this so but to answer your question which you initially asked the first thing is what you've told me marijuana does for you I don't understand why you want it because here's the thing I I want to unwind it is my time to unwind so for example if I'm playing unwind when you're asleep but I'm playing fortnite what the [ __ ] do I need my brain for for to win to win it's a battle you have to destroy your enemies what do you mean to sit there and just lose do you do you play video games yet or no sometimes when I was on house arrest I started playing Super Smash BRS what about fortnite no I don't play fortnite no okay would you ever drop in with me only if I listen if I start playing fortnite and I Lose I'm going to end up being the best fortnite player on the planet and I've got more construct cuz I can't take the L and I've got more constructive things to do with my time Dr it once in the B bro no I can't do it we'll play we'll play Super Smash BRS I'll get Kirby and I'll beat your ass I don't know what Super Smash I'm not that little piece of gum is going to mess you up it's like the Airhead just fear fear this picture cuz it's coming for you what is a gum you don't know what Kirby is no bro you're smoking too much weed what anyway what weed does for you I don't know why you want it that's the first thing second thing I'll say is this I don't know whether you should quit or not I appreciate you being honest I don't but the fact that you struggle to understand whether you could or not I believe is a problem so for me right should I quit cigars well I don't think so maybe I should maybe I shouldn't whatever but I know I could without a single drop of hesitancy I could instantly quit so you should know I forgot to mention one important thing sure uh when I was in high school never touched it because I was I was trying to get to where I was yeah High School I mean College I don't know how you like this what do you mean bro I'm so glad I don't like it cuz it's not [ __ ] that brand oh god there so much like uh taste flavor Brilliance sure excitement I want this out of my mouth e numbers College I never had the party thinge I never did out that [ __ ] uh I feel like right now in my life I have no kids uh I don't I'm I'm I don't have like certain things where I need my brain to be on 24/7 I know when I have kids there's no shot I'm going to be able to do that yeah I see a good window of opportunity and I'm just scared that one day when I'm like waking up at 3:00 in the morning cuz I have kids or like all the [ __ ] I'll be like I should have enjoyed my time where I was like less responsibility uh this is why I smoke now because I know there's going to be a time as soon as my mind goes there I'm going to be able to walk away and I've also in the past few years I'll give myself 60 to 90 days off to make sure I'm not addicted to it so I've already trained my body to like so could you quit now instantly if you decided to 100% I've done it many times okay well then then you have then you don't have that big of a problem so if you could quit then it doesn't matter but if you were to sit and go I don't know if I could quit then you'd have to quit okay now I have the most important question of the day sure how do you feel about bottom G um cuz dude dude if you got up and danced like that man I think you would I think everybody would just agree with you I think that's what would happen I think everybody in the world would be like you know what we need to [ __ ] listen to this man look at his hips have you ever looked in the mirror and brushed your teeth and been like and just Tred to dance like him ever be honest no I've seen I've seen a couple of his videos and uh are you offended or you just like it doesn't make you laugh what is it like I mean he's made a brand off of my brand dude so funny bro I watch it is funny I mean he can dance congratulations to the guy I have nothing against the guy I mean he can dance and he's he he bought a nice jacket like mine I mean I hope he does well I had to ask that I'm so sorry I was literally writing like the dumbest qu I wrote some questions that are just when I mean seriously stupid all I'm ready cuz I was like I have to ask some fun questions and I literally labeled them fun questions and I just want to get through that and then we can jump back into the deep ones let's do it okay the first one was how do you feel about bottom G you answer that uh thank you for answering that no problem uh okay I already asked that one actually was the sneo and the Zer that was actually part of my fun questions okay uh okay two brothers one cage Jake Logan You Tristan who comes out alive you know what I'm trying so hard to not star internet beefs I'm I'm I'm really trying not to I'm I'm you could say Jake and Logan man don't worry about it no I can't lie I'm going through life I'm trying to live peaceful now I've got fed agents in my house Matrix is after me I'm just trying to live peaceful but of course I have absolute faith in myself and my brother and I know what we've been through and I know the kind of men we are okay I just I had to ask you know there's understand okay now you're away on a long trip Y and you have to leave your daughter with three people okay Candace Owens Patrick bed David Donald Trump okay well I'll choose Candace because she's a woman I trust them all that makes sense I trust them all but do you have a son I have a lot of children I don't I don't say how many but a lot you just have a flock yeah if I had a son then it'd be it'd be if it was my son it would be Patrick or Donald yeah but you had to pick for the son then I'd pick Patrick because I think Patrick also has young sons and it'd be good I think it's good comp great father yeah it'd be good for them all to be together and like wrestling and fighting and you know boxing [ __ ] man he's mastered being a dad yeah after our podcast I went to his house at dinner with him and his father bro not him and his family bro I was like mesmerized and I was so so eager to have that life dude he has a great life bro no there's there there's nothing better in life than children you'll never regret children no matter you can say I don't feel ready I don't that when they turn off you'll be glad you did it your only regret you'll have is that you didn't start earlier really 100% I'm starting to catch that fever bro bro I don't I hate when people talk about their kids like I don't give a [ __ ] about your kids bro like they get so excited talking about their kids but lately I started that's got be like me see I have no real I don't I don't talk to anybody so I don't have any friends besides my guys who know me and none of us talk about our kids none of us yeah I agree with you is boring it's like look at this picture [ __ ] off I barely want to talk to you guys get out of here so okay so you don't hang out people but you're always on this hunt to change and build yourself and build I I have the same five people I'm with every day what's your fun what do you do for fun but this is a question so now let's look at this okay what let me ask you go what is fun fun is when you're tell me something fun something fun I think this is fun EXA this is work true okay fun okay fun is when you're having a lot of joy and less work but what if you have Joy during your work I do have joy when I work so do I I love working all I do is work and people say why do you mean all you do is work because there's there's nothing else to do anyway the only time I'm not working is if I'm fighting which you can still consider work because I consider it training or sometimes I'll drive one of my 53 cars in a circle I'll go out racing around the mountains in a Ferrari but I'll film it all and it'll end up be on the internet so it'll end up being work yeah so what do I do that's not work that I enjoy I mean I look at people who are having fun and those are the people who I don't believe are chasing Pride or chasing happiness and I feel like they're wasting their lives trying to have fun trying to be happy is the biggest waste of life you know what I saw the other day it's it's remarkable you're not going to believe this I saw thousands of people take drugs and stand close to each other in a big sweaty pit like a bunch of peasants and jump up and down listening to a song they could listen to on YouTube for free and they paid money to do it it was called a festival and it was disgusting and I see these humans stand there I'm like what the [ __ ] is no wonder you're [ __ ] broke broke you're an idiot you're you're dumb as [ __ ] you're a [ __ ] like festivals are crap concerts are crap clubs are crap what's fun nothing's fun the only thing that's fun is masculine achievement and being respected for being monumentally successful and competent and crushing your enemies with your Brut brutal Brilliance turning up and saying I'm going to make more money than all of you I'm going to be more famous than all of you I'm the best watch me and winning that is fun and then the only techically that's video games but you're doing in real life again in real life I have no time for games house AR rest be found a few hours now I'm back out here in the real world everyone must pay the price but even then the only things that I find fun now the only thing I do for fun is okay I'll take my sf9 around cirle that's a $700,000 car my fund's expensive I need a lot of money to even find anything I find remotely entertaining a beautiful friend of mine she's in Bali and she's like I can't wait till her free we're going to go to Bali look at this Villa I'm like if I went to that Villa do you know what I would do I was like what are you doing there she's like I'm doing yoga and I had breakfast and I'm looking at the forest and we're go see the monkeys said if I went to Bali do you know what I'd do I'd sit on my laptop I would turn up at the Villa and go which room's mine okay laptop coffee please coffee laptop it'd be the same as Romania in Bali and when I go to Dubai it's the same that's what I do I work and I want to make this very clear to people because I find it amazing when people say they don't have motivation I have people come to me and say I want to get rich I don't have motivation I want to work harder said how can you not have motivation to get rich when somebody like me with a head start like mine is still working 18 hour days every single day seven days a week without having a day off I'm going to crush you you don't stand a chance I will beat you and you're just going to sit there and perpetually lose because you can't find the motivation to crawl up out the mud and stay a bug until you end up in your 15minute city getting your 17th injection like a dummy like a useless eater all I do is work nothing is fun I don't have fun I don't even understand Sports I don't understand the concept of fun the only sport where I ever did was beating the [ __ ] out people is that fun why did you get into fighting because I was a chess player and chess and fighting are remarkably similar very you have to know what your next move is going to be countering his next move and there's no luck if you lose you made a mistake there's no such thing as a lucky punch if if I'm losing a fight or if I'm beating some guy up and he hits me with one shot and knocks me out and people go that's a lucky punch he's trained his whole life to punch people in the face and he punched me in the face you call that lucky I'll call that good I think it was a very good punch excellent probably his best punch of his career no such thing as lucky punches same thing with chess if you L also you left your guard down absolutely it's my fault same thing with chess brutal self-accountability if you lose you made a mistake somewhere how do you learn that you have to go back reflect you have to watch the game back play the game back where did I make the mistake you don't blame your opponent you blame yourself always in chess it's self-accountability so when I stopped playing professional chess I decided to move over to fight because they're very similar it's one-on-one it's not team sport so that's why I chose to fight but I never considered fighting fun I never took it as hahaa this is fun I was out to hurt people for real so I can't think of what I do for fun or any fun I've ever had I am of course human I love sitting around with my boys and laughing I don't think there's any higher experience for men than sitting around with your boys having a laugh and having a joke I think that's as good as life gets you can have a billion dollars like me or you can be at the bottom but if you're with five people you truly love your guys and you've been with them and you trust them and you're smoking a cigar or not and you're sitting around telling stories and everyone's laughing that's as good as life gets at the top of the bottom on jet or on the jet or or home in the in the in the trenches it doesn't matter what yeah on the jet all you do is that and and at the bottom all you do is that so that's as good as life gets anyway so I I'll consider that fun I mean I guess I do like road trips I like to drive around Europe from Spain to France to Italy and are you allowed to do that now not now last summer we got a bunch of Ferraris together 10 Ferraris and we raced all across Europe and that was fun but we film it all so it's still kind of work but yeah I don't even but you put yourself in a position where all your fun could be wor of course but my point is I don't don't understand or I don't fathom the concept of fun I don't wake up and think what can I do for fun I don't wake up and think what is fun I want fun that never crosses my mind I wake up and think I have things to do and if I don't have things to do I'll find things to do you can always do more work you could there's no such thing as no work to do after this podcast is done you can release it and you can make X amounts of Clips that's going to be done and then you could watch it back and you you could analyze every word you've ever said and you could find a way to say it differently you could look at a dictionary and find new words and you could learn them and you can memorize them all then you could sit down and you could rehearse it and use those words and sentences to make sure you pronounce them correctly and you don't make any mistakes then you could always do more work from the same thing the work is never ending the money is never ending so you have to find joy in your work you have to find purpose at least I don't know if I even find joy in my work because I'm stressed and annoyed I'm furious all the time what do you mean we've made $1.3 million today it's a joke flip the computer but it's it's you have you have to conquer the Earth why why let's talk about this why did genas Khan wake up and think you know what what can I do for fun well I can play this instrument that [ __ ] play the instrument for me boring okay let me [ __ ] this girl [ __ ] her let me [ __ ] her oh kid number 84 boring what's s do you know what you know what guys let's all get our horses and let's just ride over there and who whatever we find let's just take it why because it's the instinct to conquer it's inside of a man it's been dumbed B Down By The Matrix they try and numb you they numb you with entertainment they try and put you in the festival crowd they numb you with [ __ ] food they numb you with depression all this other garbage but truthfully if you're a man you look in the mirror what will make me happy my Empire will make me happy that's why Alexander the Great did what he did and Julius Caesar did what he did and genas Khan did what he did they didn't have Google Maps they didn't know where they were going they said no no we've decided we're going to go take [ __ ] from other people and show we're the best and that's what we're doing now the successful men at least in a financial sense why am I making money I have nothing to buy there's nothing to buy I have it all I have four kernin eggs a rimac a Bugatti 53 other cars 40 properties there's nothing to buy I'm just taking it from other people I'm winning the game I'm conquering and that's what I think truly is going to give you purpose in life it's just Conquest men have always been this way that's why war was even happening in the first place the Mongols raided Vienna how long does it take to ride from anulan Batar Mongolia on a horse to Vienna Austria across all of Siberia and they were still mad enough and bored enough to go now we need that City over there that's the masculine Essence and it's been numbed down inside of people do you think they were ever considering fun at any point during this Conquest cuz I don't think they were well do you think they were just trying to dominate others I don't think is about trying to dominate I think that inside of every single man there's a a god-given I think that the entire world was built by this god-given drive to conquer and to conquer doesn't always mean dominate others you can conquer the Sky by building a skyscraper you can you can conquer by building roads you can conquer by construction not only by destruction you conquer by turning up to a new territory and having a beautiful family and creating children I think that's inside of every single man I think it's been dumbed down by the Matrix but I'm uninterested in fun I don't understand the concept of fun fun is for women and children all the women around me have fun last night last night I went to a restaurant my brother and I three or four friends maybe 25 of the most beautiful women you've ever seen in your life we sit down at this table all this fancy food comes all these bottles of champagne come everyone comes the girls are laughing drinking everyone's having fun never at any point during the entire experience did I have any fun I sat down on my phone checked how much money I had again did some work replied to important people spoke to my fight coach about training and important things spoke to the War Room about important things in Conquest spoke to my legal team everyone around me is having fun I'm getting things done looks like I'm having fun but never did I ever for a second feel fun and I didn't want to I didn't try and join in the fun I didn't try and go yeah yeah no I pay for at all you all have fun I'm going to do this and I say this there's a I say this all the time to the people I care about your life is fun and my life is stress but you are mine that's how it works you're my woman so you're allowed to have fun and my life is going to stay stress but you are mine I have my fun via proxy by making sure everybody I love have fun I don't want any fun so you have fun in providing I provide fun but I don't have any fun I don't even have fun in providing fun it's just my obligation everyone around me has fun I'm working and I cannot explain does Tristan have the same mindset of this or does he like to have more fun he likes to have a little bit more fun than I do you might I can see that he looks a little bit happier but it's not happy this is the point I want to make this very clear to the people at home I don't want anyone at home to think that I'm unhappy or depressed or miserable from this I this is just how I view the world I don't I don't want to have fun I don't know how else to say it I don't look at fun and go I'm missing out I look at fun and going I'm glad they're enjoying they're fun it's like food do you want this cake no everyone else wants it I'm glad they want the cake cake tastes good it's great but I don't want the cake I want something else I will provide the cake I'm a baker I can give you cake but I don't want any I don't think in the concept of fun I don't enjoy fun ever all I want to do is monumentally Achieve endlessly that's all I'm interested in so we went to your past we figured out why why you were built like this um we talked about the dilemma and the obstacles that you've overcome we talked about moving into the next season what do you feel is your next season and also I don't know if this parlays but the training talking to your trainer and your your training as much as how I see Jake train for his fights why are you preparing for a legitimate fight are you wanting to go back into that or do you feel like the world fight's already big enough and you don't need to go back into the cage for that yeah a lot of it depends on what happens with this Matrix attack in regards to fights but I'm always ready and I've always stayed ready so I could fight tomorrow I'm I'm that ready but um I enjoy it and I enjoy feeling ready even though the process is suffering I enjoy to feel ready at all times hence why I'm always training in regards to what the next stage is well I have personal goals as well outside of my internet goals and my career goals and this is actually something very interesting I want to tie back into our earlier conversation when we were talking about monogamy and poly poly polyamory and all these other things because it's my goal to have as many children as possible is it so you could have your offsprings deliver your message or because you just want kids like manyi disciples running around and being like if you have if you you have an Empire you need heirs right y if you have a large empire you need a lot of airs right M so I want at least 25 children so what do you think oh you're trying to mean Nick Canon out here yeah so what do you think from a religious perspective about someone who is destined on having as many children as possible but obviously to do that he would need more than one woman do you still think that's a sin o um well I think putting your needs above Gods is a sin so you need 25 kids it's interesting is it my needs is it selfishness well you just said you were like well God is it you knew that it was to be against God because God just wants you to have one woman perfect to be honest with you I've never read the Bible cover to cover so I don't know if it is spoiler alert one man one woman yeah yeah sounds like a boring book but you know why he does that it's it's it's to preserve Society no it's just to to demonstrate your relationship with him because once you stop you love okay think about this right you love a woman Y and you provide a family yep a covenant yep a kingdom but then you get to the point you're like I need more this is what Adam did with God I need more don't you feel like let me answer ask the question from another way don't you think the good people and the intelligent people of Earth need to be having kids at least at the same rate as the idiots I mean we have a population no no it's a great question we have and this and we can also look at this we can take it away from the religious argument look at it another way we have a serious population crisis in the west if you want I don't know if you know about this but there's a huge demographic collapse incoming and the reason we have these Mass numbers of immigration is and the reason our cultures are collapsing is because we no longer reproduce at the at the basic rate of s staining population so two people are supposed to have 3.7 kids on average for the population to increase but how many people do you know with four children very rare none so two people have one kid population goes down two people have two kids population still goes down because people die people die in car crashes these kind of things so we have huge problems from a socioeconomic point of view because you now have people living longer because of medicine they have longer pensions longer retirements they need to be paid for you're supposed to have a huge tax space of young people working we don't have anyone having enough children to sustain the tax base so what the people in charge of the world are doing is saying okay well then we need to import third worlders to sustain this entire pyramid scheme we have this Ponzi scheme of you working your ass off so you can retire later we need have to import third world wars who are going to work for pennies and they'll pay taxes so we can sustain it but that's why all the cultures are collapsing so you look at this very interesting a Christian country is now being invaded by Muslims and third worlders and you're losing your Christian identity because you don't have enough children to sustain the population yeah because you're only allowed one woman got it so this is a interesting point where whereas a Muslim man can have four wives and 16 kids just pump them out and they can survive and protect their identity and their culture and their religion so it's actually very interesting and before I let you answer only one country solved this Hungary Hungary is a Christian Nation and Victor Orban is one of the smartest world leaders on the planet he abolished income tax for any family that has more than four children and he's fixed the population risis and the population is increasing because people are getting married and having kids hungary's fixed it no other nation has fixed it because you can't even afford to have four or five children because they're decimating you and destroying the currency and they're just doing all this Matrix propaganda on purpose anyway so besides Hungary every other Western nation is now importing the Islamic world to sustain itself because Christian nations can't reproduce so it's interesting what you said I agree with what you said but it's also the the death throws of Christianity Christianity is about to be decimated because of that because what do you have without people you have my answer yeah okay first would you like more coffee yeah I'll have two more coffees please can we get two more coffees thank you you want some more coffee sure read sure please give my men coffee okay my answer is this never in the day of age did we ever have the power to talk to a mass group of people since the internet y so ironically we're running into this problem of less of our people but we also have the gift of reaching out to more people correct so another household could have five kids but who's to say that I can't encourage them to have my morals and standpoints absolutely you you couldn't you could you could I don't need I don't need to procreate I need to provide and educate that's very interesting point of view but then you also this brings us into the Islam versus Christianity argument and I want to make it very clear to the world that I am not anti-christian in any way most of my family is Christian my brother is Christian for a long time when I first Tristan is Christian yeah he's Christian cool he's he's happy and he has fun yeah that's right perhaps perhaps that's why when I first stopped being atheistic I reverted or diverted to Christianity because it was all I knew because I was raised Christian I went to church as a kid it's all I knew but you're talking about the fact that yeah people can come into the nation but if they become Christians once they arrive then the Christian Christian faith survives yeah but I think that for that to happen there would have to be some form of power gap or power vacuum and it's not atheists which are arriving and it's going to be very difficult to convince them out of Islam into Christianity and I I'll tell you why I am not an Islamic scholar and I don't consider myself knowledgeable on Islam I'm new to the religion I'm only a year in and I'm studying as best I can but there's a lot of people who know more than me but from my understanding and my practi is Islam is very rigid and it's strict and you know what's right and you know what's wrong and it provides Solutions and answers in a very strict non-ambiguous way and I feel like if you live a difficult life like we talked about earlier about why my fan basee is so galvanized and why they believe in me because I offer rigid solutions to problems and if you come from a difficult place or you Graz in a difficult country or a war zone you're going to look for that R rigidity I don't think the softness of Christianity and I don't say that as an insult I just state that as a matter of fact will be appealing to people who have come from war zones I I just don't I think it's going to be very difficult to convert them to Christianity and and we're seeing now in the Western World huge proportion of Christian countries are now just becoming Islamic strongholds and and they can't be penetrated or or changed okay so but you're making it seem like a lot of people that uh that worship Islam they're very very strict with their policies there's a l there's a lot that I and by the way let me speak positively about Islam so people don't confuse my my nature we're friends here by the way everyone we're on the same yeah I I age don't speak for me I'm kid no no no uh uh no I actually I I really really really really really respect Islam for one reason the way they stand up for their God absolutely and I actually take notes from them so I don't want anybody in fact my God is their Prophet yep so we do we do see a lot of eye to eye we just don't see the the final destination of who God is correct um but I definitely respect anybody in their in their faith and I think it's I'd rather you have faith in a God then you have no faith in God at all AG so we're on the same planfield okay um but to say that Christians have values and they don't follow them and Islam does it's not true I I have many friends for example you're Islamic now but you drink and you smoke no I don't drink oh not anymore but there's a lot that I have friends with that do so the theory of them not following their rules is that's just a man I don't think that's a religion I think every man falls short I think I think this is the truth I think an Islamic man that stands in front of me sins against God and I think a Christian man sins against God oh yeah we're not perfect in any regard but let's tie back to something I said earlier we're not perfect in any regard and it's all down to how you once again measure the success of a religion we talked earlier about measuring the success of a business and life About Money numbers right numb but why is numbers account when it comes to Faith I think it should be your well that's that's it it should be your faith but faith is very intangible and hard to measure so I I'm just use be using my limited human brain let's just try and measure the success of a religion the fastest growing religion is Islam it's not the biggest it's the fastest growing yeah I think if you were to look at the insanity of the West I think Islam opposes it hardest in regards to the the pure Insanity that is being inflicted upon and bestowed upon children in the west I think Islam I want to say something a compliment for them what I I do appreciate is that they they they don't let you cross bounds right so for example when they were making a mockery of my Lord and Savior yeah I didn't see Christians trying to tear down these movies I see Christians trying to hey that's not okay blah BL blah right Islamic people were like you're not talking about a prophet like that so I I find that very beautiful and I understand that they hold their values but let me ask you a question do you not find that appealing very do you not find it appealing to be part of a religion where you get to stand up for what you really believe in and say no you can't say that no you won't do that no not to us yeah I think they have beautiful qualities that I should learn from but that doesn't mean I have to worship their God I mean people often ask why reverted to Islam and I I I heard someone say something that you see life and you see other people as you see yourself so if you're a thief you think everyone's a thief you're worried about everyone stealing from you because you would steal in their position that's how you like view the world that's how cheaters view that's how cheaters view the world that's right and then I was sitting thinking well maybe and of course this just came from my mind I said well maybe you see a religion how you see yourself like I see myself as somebody who is feared nobody would want to mock I see myself as somebody with strict standards and discipline I see myself as somebody who stands up for what he believes in and doesn't care if he's assaulted and attacked for it maybe that's why it was so appealing to me I and then I I'd sit and I'd study it and I'd read and I'd realize how close it actually is to Christianity we believe in so many of the same things and I don't want to get in trouble here because I am not an Islamic scholar in any way but I've had even other people say to me some Christians who I spoke to who started to read the Quran they're like it's just condensed it's like Stronger Yeah and and and I think that's what the appeal of it is to me and I I also like having hard yeses and Nos and I I believe that if you have a religion where you just accept everything yeah then you believe in nothing there has to be a line in life there has to be a line that you won't let someone cross and with God there should be the same and my only concern with Christianity and I I argue this with my brother at length is if God will really truly forgive anything then then then if he'll truly forgive you doing the most pest acts you can possibly think of and you repeatedly do them and you won't learn your lesson and you'll do them over and over again and even Christians themselves won't ostracize you is that too far is that too much Freedom like you asked earlier I love this so this is beautiful it's actually in my notes I was going to circle this with it um Let me let me just give me a second to make sure I word this properly absolutely for let's Circle to forgiveness yeah how many times should you forgive a man well that's a really good question cuz we are sinners and we make endless mistakes and the prophet that you see as Jesus do you know what he talks about forgiveness as tell me he Peter asks him how many times should you forgive a man and he says stimes 77 and then he also describes the way Judgment Day comes and he goes you will be measured by the measurement that you gave others so the way you looked at your brothers and sisters that man wronged you but you said you're dead to me you're you're debt I don't even want it yeah that's how you'll be measured but here let me Circle back repentance isn't doing the same sin over and over and enjoying it and asking for forgiveness that's why God doesn't judge your actions like I said he judges the reflection of your heart yeah so if I sinned against you there's two types of men Andrew dude listen I'm a police Andrew I messed up dude like I'm so sorry that I did this D I didn't mean it this is what happened and you could see the stress in his eyes from him hurting you hey Dad that I know you told me not to do this and I was I was with my friends and or hey Andrew my bad bro yeah it won't happen again this [ __ ] guy yeah yeah there's a difference of course you can't hide your heart from God absolutely so I that's why I say only God could judge and and I remember what I was going to say about uh your God and my God right I believe that if there is a God out there he wants you to come in the same direction that I'm going vice versa so I think I never want to uh debate religion ever because then I'm trying to disprove your God and that might be holding your heart and I don't want to do that I age but what we could do is I say I'll pray to my God and you pray to your God to open up one of our eyes and hearts and whoever is wrong or whoever is Right will guide us with wisdom to the right direction I love that and you know what I kind of feel like when I'm talking to people of other religious faiths and I like I said I have to be very careful I'm not an Islamic scholar and like you said I don't want to ever insult Christians or insult other religious faiths the only people I have I like to argue with correctly and properly are atheists because they need to learn the light yeah I'll join I'm kidding I feel like if if there's one god let's imagine there's one sentence and it's the most beautiful sentence that you can possibly think of that can be constructed with the most compend and gorgeous language that can be put together I feel like the different religions are perhap perhaps different languages to say the same thing Y and you know German sounds different to Russian sounds different to English but you can say it in different ways but it all means the same thing and I feel like that's the best way to look at it and to a degree the Quran also says the same thing it says that we're a lot closer than we are apart and I think when I meet somebody of another faith I still feel happy for them and I feel glad for them it's only when I meet somebody who sits down and thinks they're a smart ass oh no we came from monkeys I'm like oh bro you need help those are the people I argue with uh those people are more lost than ever and here's the thing man like a lot of people will ask me like how do you forgive CU forgiveness is such a sometimes it gets so hard especially when you know that that person wrongs you purposefully y um and my theory goes back to this forget the way I measures the way he's going to measure me y but my God came and paid a penalty for me y because I couldn't pay that penalty how can I look at another man knowing that every time I come on my knees and I say God like provide me shelter provide me safety provide me this and he always comes through for me and then I Wrong him him I walk and by the way this is the worst part I walk into sin willingly man you think that I feel good having sex with my girlfriend I do that's besides the point I felt I I had to say I do because I do have I do I felt like I was going to lie she's watching I do have I have great time having sex but afterwards it like it haunts me because we're not married okay that was a bad example let me take that out because that was a that's I'm walk but you know what no that's true cuz I walk into that right I walk into sin that was my choice I walked into it but God knows my heart he knows what I'm dealing with he knows my steps he hovers me because I ask him to go before me so he's making the path for me now people when they see me talk about God they make it seem like I'm so holier than thou and I don't make mistakes no the beautiful part is I am an endless bucket of mistakes we all are but how gracious is God to be like I get it man yeah and I think the way we get out of sin and the blessings that are given to us like you were blessed but do you know why you were blessed because you were given the privilege of wisdom yeah there's another top G somewhere else same body same brain same everything but he didn't have that wisdom and wisdom was given to you Proverbs in the Bible was a king and he could have asked anything from God and he goes I just want wisdom how does God give wisdom to you how does he give wisdom to me first you got to seek and you shall find knock and the door shall be open right so it's like what are you asking for for example when I asked God to be in this meeting I don't go hey God please make sure I have a great great podcast and I kill it and I get views no I go God hey let me stir up a conversation that wakes up somebody's heart but for me to do that I need to be prepared so prepare me to be a man that could talk against a man who's very diligent with his tongue I wasn't prepared for this God made me prepared for this abut so when I ask God for things I don't get lazy with my prayers I don't go hey God make me a rich famous man now how do you get there if God was sitting at this table and we're going to try to to conquer this world in a healthy way how are we going to do it we got to ask for steps first I need a good team I need good Hearts I need the right tools people are asking God as if he's a make a wish Genie like just like hey I want a a baddy with a fatty it's like bro what do you what do you go on like what you some of the prayers that people ask that God doesn't even deliver it's better for them not to have it he knows best he knows best but I also feel like God gives wisdom God gives wisdom through tribulation and suffering I'm smarter because of jail he wanted to teach me something but question did you not ask for this life first oh absolutely so what came first was it the fact that you thirsted for a higher life or was it that God threw you into that because for me if you asked me to be a trainer hey I need you to train me I'm going to put you through your test oh absolutely so you asked God for that he didn't just put you in that circumstance and and that's one of the things that's very interesting you have people who will sit at home and pray for an exceptional life they'll say I don't want to live a normal life I want an exceptional life I want a special life a different life and then they'll do exceptional things they'll fly on a private jet they'll buy a Bugatti they'll sit in a $10 million mansion somewhere on the coast and then cry if they end up in jail exceptional doesn't always mean good exceptional means deviate from the norm you begged God for exceptional a Romanian jail cell is a unique experience just as a Bugatti on a private jet is a unique experience if you want the experiences there's no light without dark you can't have both if you're going to pray to God and ask for all these amazing things you have to understand there's an equal and opposite force and you will pay the price and who here there's a beautiful thing let me backtrack that one line you just said you could pray for something but remember there's two people on the phone listening to your prayers yeah I like that and here's the craziest part you know when who's giving it to you yep you know deep in your heart you can feel it of course you can feel it you're lying to me if you say you can't feel and you know what maybe that's where I'm self-reflecting we're talking about being vulnerable I'll be vulnerable maybe that's actually where a lot of my motivation comes from despite the fact I think I'm genuinely putting my life and my livelihood in danger by speaking so much truth against the Matrix is if I was getting all of this money and all of this Fame and I wasn't talking about God and doing good for the world I'd be very sure the devil was giving it to me I'd feel it I'd feel cheap I'd feel dirty and I would feel anxious like okay I've got this Fame what am I doing for the world okay I may be entertaining I may get some views I may get some clicks but what am I giving the people who believe in me am I scamming them am I Hur in them are they getting better what am I doing for the people who know my name am I just taking all this [ __ ] from the devil and I'm not giving anything back am I actually making anyone feel better about themselves and then you sit there and realize that yeah you are you're taking it from the devil you'll pay the price tenfold with your soul this is why I sit this is why I sit and find The Bravery to think I'm currently on bail in the middle of a judicial process inside of the country we are sitting in right now I've been advised by all legal counsil to not do podcasts here I am doing a podcast why because I know people will listen to it and I can give a good message out there and I believe that I can D drive people in a holy Direction regardless of which religion whether they choose Christianity or Islam I believe there will be people who watch this and decide to believe in God that's worth it to me and then the money I'm achieving 10 years from now whatever I know it came from me trying to do the right thing I didn't scam people on crypto I didn't sell [ __ ] to kids I didn't do none of that stuff that that is from the devil and you will pay the price for that you can't there's no light without dark you can't just go through life robbing banks and think you're going to get away with it I I got a I got a parable for you that's in the Bible and I think this kind of relates to you a little bit but before I say that can I and and be honest with me do you feel like in your heart that if you did not do that for God or if you did not do it you feel like it's going to be taken away from you yes there's a parable in the Bible and I'm going to rephrase it so I want people to go read it because I'm going to most likely not do it justice but I'm going to speak in a way that people could understand we'll say a king comes up to three servants he goes I'm going to give you four pieces of gold or no no no crops we'll say crops right four crops for you two crops for you one crop for you go plant your Fields the one with four goes awesome look what God gave me boom boom boom and he made it like so much the second one who had two he goes wow he gave me two boom boom boom boom boom and I did it okay the one who has one goes oh man I don't want to mess up with the one thing that he gave me give the other guy like four three and then I'm going to mess this up okay you know what I'm going to do I'm going to hide it I'm going to hide it and then when God comes back I'm like hey man I didn't lose it look I have it right here you know what God did he cursed them he said give it to me and he gave it to the one who could multiply it because at the end he thought that all of the glory was because of him but he should have known that if it did well it was going to be for God so there was no failing you have to go out and know that everything was given to you and it's a privilege to be in the chair that you're in absolutely have that voice that you have that can tune into so many of these kids ears there's a responsibility that you're holding I truly think the next Journey that you're going to have is a spiritual one yeah I think it is oh and you're completely right and and when you asked me the question that I said yes to the reason I said yes is if God gave me this platform and then I acted a coward and I was afraid to talk because of the Matrix or because they came for me or because I'll lose my money or because they'll lock me up I would pay for that cowardice he would give it to the one who's not a coward he' give it to the man who's not a coward which might be the reason that gave it to me in the first place because I was the one who was standing up fighting against all this [ __ ] earlier on it's the one who did it I was the one who went nuts and I think that's why you were boasted in Pride because at the moment he's like I'm not going to remove that from him just yet because that's what's fueling him regardless I need him to do that job Apostle Paul he killed people he was killing Christians he just destroys this Christian that was a disciple in front of him and that Christian was like this is so predictable look at you guys he goes you guys have done this on and on and on and then God took Paul and made him one of the greatest disciples this is an ongoing thing that people don't understand it's usually the people that God the humans would be like God would never use that guy and there's like oh use that guy when Jesus was born the first thing they asked is from where that's their first question from the ghetto what good comes from that place why are they why the kings of Kings is coming from there don't believe it are Kings coming in on a donkey I don't believe it yeah I think I know you don't talk to people I know that after you're done with a podcast you kind of go on and do what you need to do but I would love to stay in contact because I feel like we could sharpen each other I think so too I think it would be very interesting certainly I think uh to be honest I I would love to extend the conversation but sometimes when I feel like it's it's ready to go it's ready to go we have part two ready already lined up so it'll happen some point some point in the future thank you so much for being here man I really and truly cuz like this this is uh putting my show in different map and I think you know that too and I really appreciate your time thank thanks for coming friend they never believe me I would never drop the ball I know I make it look easy
