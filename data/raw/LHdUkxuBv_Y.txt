A well-played game of chess is a sign of a gentleman, but an expertly played game of chess is the sign of a wasted life. I mean, again, separate of everything else though, I would say that that's not actually crazy. For example, his his father, Emory Tate, was a very strong chess player. It's someone who was an international master, but also someone who who did not make a great living from playing the game of chess. So, it is true. What would you have made of your success? He would be extremely underwhelmed by it because he always expected. I am going to take the third. I the general things about chess I think are true. Some of this other stuff is starting to get a little bit off the rails.
