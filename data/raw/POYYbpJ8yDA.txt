I also believe that God can be proud of you when you do your absolute best and I don't think many people genuinely do their best in the world anymore when I say do your best people sit and go oh yeah okay no when's the last time you actually did your best like I don't train to run marathons but I know if I gave my best I could run a marathon right now first try if I gave my best life depending on it when's the last time people have genuinely given their best to anything there are people going through the world and going through life today don't give their best or 100% effort to anything ever ever they can't remember the last time they tried so when I'm sitting in a dungeon I'm sitting in a Romanian jail cell I understand that it is a chance that God has given me and my ancestors are watching for me to do my absolute best and to show to them that I am the man I say I am you can't become the most famous man in the world for mental resilience and God not test your mental resilience I think that would be a very amateur way to view the world that you can now become one of the most famous men in the world who talks about mental discipline and mental resilience and God's not going to test it I think God's going to come along and say okay you want to be Mr famous all right let's see what you have so I believed it was a a a chance to show God and show my ancestors and show my father that I am the man I say I am it says in the Quran just because you believe you think Al will not test you just because you believe in me you think you're not going to be tested I think being tested is a great thing for that's how God shows love yeah because God yeah because God's love is a disciplinarian love it's a masculine love it's like a father a father shows love through putting you on the bike letting you fall over letting you hurt your knee picking you back up putting you back on the bike that's how a father shows love and God is the same we learn through pain and suffering which is why God gives it to us because God is here to teach us God is like a father and a father teaches you I believe through pain if a dad wants to teach you how to ride a bike he puts you on the bike let you fall off and get hurt puts you back on the bike over and over and over until you can ride the bike God does the same thing you don't get the lessons you want you get the lessons you need absolutely agree so I believe that bad things happening to you are a fantastic thing I believe you need to be strong enough to deal with them and then are ulate though some people only learn the hard way especially men God gives us God's actually very nice because I believe God gives us a whole bunch of chances to learn a lesson the easy way it's called life of course he'll give you think of think of the think of the harshest lesson you don't even have to say what it is but think of the harshest lesson you've had in the last few years and think of how many times you had the easy way to learn that lesson before it got bad how many times you could have just woke up and go nah we don't do we we wake up like ah we got away with it it's fine and then bam you get hit there's only two ways to learn lessons hard and harder if you're if you're smart you take it the hard way real idiots take it the hardest way but there's no easy way to learn lessons so you're right I agree with everything you say and that's and that's how God teaches anyway that's how God is always going to teach because God is a disciplinarian love I think it says someone said this to me I think in school you learn things and then you're given a test but with God you're given the test and then you learn things and that's the way it works the thing for me was actually I guess a scientific principle it was Newton's law of equal and opposite Force if there is evil in the world and and I'd like to think we both agree there certainly is yes there has to be an equal and opposite Force which is good and I would like to think that that is God even the idea of God as a notion even just as a concept if that idea of God resists evil then God is real if you have two islands you have two people let's say a ship crashes and you have two people who swim to two different islands and one Island they're atheists Savages and they rip you apart in the other Island you get there and they believe in God and they believe that their idea of God God saved your life so I think even just the concept of God in and of itself if enough people believe in it makes them do good then God must be true and that's the equal and opposite Force to the evil of the world and this is how I I view it so I don't see how anybody with a conscience canot believe in God anymore when I sat there and I became religious because I realize there's so much evil in the world God must exist you can't equal and opposite Force darkness dark I see so much pure evil the devil must be real which means God must be real it's interesting that this is almost proof for God and some many ways when you're going to wake up and realize that there is genuine evil in the world there's genuine good in the world and there are two sides and two camps and I do believe that the good is on the side of Truth and I do believe that comes from God and there's many different ways to God I think there is one God and there's different religions and I don't want to argue that the differences between the religions because I think we have a lot more in common than we have especially in the fight against evil than we have as differences when you start to analyze people who are a they not even smart enough to look at the big picture and realize without God there's nothing yeah you have nothing but anarch Ary and chaos and I tell you when 10 armed men turn up at your house putting a gun to your head You'll wish God was there you'll be praying then Mr atheist Mr tough guy then you'll start talking about God and it could have been prevented in the first place if Society was preserved if there weren't atheists like you talking Godless that's what these clowns don't even understand without God there's nothing it's all a joke I'm far more embarrassed about old videos I made that were anti- good I feel genuinely bad about those much worse than that I'm doing the absolute opposite right I'm trying to push children towards religion I'm trying to push kids towards God and I feel like Christianity has lost a lot of its presence in recent times and that breaks my heart I'm a Muslim now but that breaks my heart because people of the book are people of the book and we need more God not less God and I don't care what God you worship if you worship God and you're a good person and it's a shame really that Christianity's reached a point where it's mocked so openly and so publicly in Christian nations that breaks my heart I think the attraction of Islam for me personally and also for a lot of other people now is there's a lot of people who are just tired of being mocked and they want a religion which they respect and other people respect and you can disagree with Islam all you want and whether you're an atheist or you're a Christian You can disagree with all you want and I'm not an Islamic scholar to argue that point however I will argue the point that it is the most respected religion on the planet nobody openly mocks it without fear if they do they at least make sure they're very careful about hiding their face or hiding behind a police barricade whereas people will mock Christianity openly and think it's a joke and I feel like it's time for the Christians to take power back by ensuring that the religion is respected I mean people often ask why I reverted to Islam and I I I heard someone say something that you see life and you see other people as you see yourself so if you're a thief you think everyone's a thief you're worried about everyone stealing from you because you would steal in their position that's how you like view the world that's how cheaters view that's how cheaters view the world that's right and then I was sitting thinking well maybe and of course this just came from my mind I said well maybe you see a religion how you see yourself like I see myself as somebody who is feared nobody would want to mock I see myself as somebody with strict standards and discipline I see myself as somebody who stands up for what he believes in and doesn't care if he's assaulted and attacked for it maybe that's why it was so appealing to me I and then I I'd sit and I'd study it and I'd read and I'd realize how close actually is to Christianity we believe in so many of the same things and I don't want to get in trouble cuz I am not an Islamic scholar in any way but I've had even other people say to me some Christians who I spoke to who started to read the Quran they're like it's just condensed it's like Stronger Yeah and and and I think that's what the appeal of it is to me and I I also like having hard yeses and Nos and I I believe that if you have a religion where you just accept everything yeah then you believe in nothing there has to be a line in life there has to be a line that you won't let someone cross and with God there should be the same and my only concern conern with Christianity and I I argue this with my brother at length is if God will really truly forgive anything if he'll truly forgive you doing the most heinous acts you can possibly think of and you repeatedly do them and you won't learn your lesson and you'll do them over and over again and even Christians themselves won't ostracize you is that too far is that too much freedom but in general if you look at most Christian countries in the west it's insane a man just got charged with a hate crime for removing the head of a devil statue that Satanist said put inside a church and he took the head off it and he is being charged with a hate crime him in a Christian country Christianity has lost all of its merits as a religion if you do not have strong parameters of what is right and what is wrong and if you're afraid to say them go to a Christian well you people can make their own choices God loves every the Bible says no done I'm not going to be part of a religion or adere to a religion that doesn't have strict beliefs cuz then it's not religion anymore you tolerate everything you stand for nothing so there's only Islam left now I'm not going to insult Christians I believe there's one God and I believe the different religions are perhaps different languages to say the same thing you can say coffee cup in German you can say coffee cup in English but it's still a coffee cup there are different ways to say the same things but Islam is so much stricter it's so much more respectable you can feel it so if you truly believe in God I don't see how you could not want to be a Muslim I don't see how you can feel any Pride in being a Christian and that's why I reverted not because I'd always believed in God but I just found the language that made the most sense to me and I don't see any other language that makes sense I feel like it's very easy choice for anyone who truly believes in God and and if you don't believe in God in the world we're currently in then I don't know what's wrong with you because God is the only one who can fix this mess so you better start believing because you're going to need him we're going to need God to fix this mess because we're going to need a global Awakening of Consciousness we need people to realize they've been l to from head to toe we need paradigms to break and when paradigms break things often get chaotic and messy and Wars come before a new paradigm is installed isn't that just the rise and thought of Empires absolutely yeah and and we have to hope that new paradigm being installed is better than the old one and what we need once again is for people to love each other and care about their community and care about their children and care about one another and if that's not God tell me what is we need God more than ever you can't replace god with anything else you can't replace it with money you can't replace it with government you you're going to need faith in God to win this because it's only faith in God that's going to make you say no I believe in ex I love my family I love where I live God wants me to tell the truth and stand up for what is Right despite the fact that I am persecuted for it we need more God why are all the people in charge of the world trying to get rid of God if he's not their enemy that's the only thing they fear the only thing they fear is people waking up and saying No this is wrong it is morally wrong and for that reason we refuse they don't want that no they want to make everything subjective it removes the subjectiveness you know what's right you know what's wrong
