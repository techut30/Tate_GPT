if you cannot control your own mind then you are just a feather in the Wind of life because your own mind is the only thing you can control you can't control the weather you can't control other people you can't even control whether your heart stops beating you might have a heart attack tomorrow you can't control anything besides what you think if you cannot control your own mind then you go through life with zero control zero influence you can't control anything you're just a feather in the wind waiting for life to blow you from happy place to sad place to happy place to sad Place completely hoping on the gods to be fortunate to you because if any genuine discomfort comes your way you're [ __ ] when I tell people that you are the sum of The Five People You spend the most time with everyone agrees they go yeah that's probably true and then they continue to hang around with people who they don't want to be why you have there has to be a point there has to be a point where you sit and go okay you're my friends etc etc I love you guys yeah we can talk whatever but I want a different life path you have to leave some people behind that self-consciousness would motivate you or they would certain instill the discipline required for you to change you don't feel self-conscious amongst your peers that's why you don't change that's life that's Humanity so I say this to people all the time if you know you're the sum of the five people you hang around with why you hang around people you don't want to be the world has become exceptionally easy for a lot of men it used to be a diff different place most men were catall most of us would have ended up in Wars dying for [ __ ] no reason damn now we don't have to do that so because we don't have to do that men think it's okay to just become comfortable now you're don't not supposed to be comfortable you were never evolve to be comfortable you're supposed to be uncomfortable right and if you find make yourself uncomfortable constructively it's very easy to be anything you want and in life you get one shot damn that's but if you get some balls that's what life is as a game that's what life is as a man this is one big video game you get to upgrade your character you're not born with any value as a man if you don't make yourself valuable you have no value you have to get up and do it just like a video game you start with [ __ ] zero you have to decide if you want to complete it you have to upgrade your character so I find it amazing that men are going to play video games and [ __ ] about and waste their time instead of upgrading their character everyone knows what to do you know what you have to do right if you had to become the most dangerous intelligent respectable man on the planet you know you're supposed to go to the gym you know you're supposed to train learn how to fight you know you know all these things you don't do them that's your that's your decision it's your prerogative I didn't I didn't make that choice I made the choice to do it all I decid it all and every single man watching this can do the exact same thing the lions that you see on TV they weren't just born big lions they had to fight other Lions they had to fight to get that antelope they had to fight other animals hyenas Jackal they had to fight to be the boss we're living in a comfortable world now where people think oh it doesn't matter it doesn't matter but you know what to some degree it does matter it does matter and I'm tell you who it matters to it matters to your soul and it matters to God I stand in the mirror with a pure heart I know I am the best version of me that could possibly ever exist I know that God is proud of me there's nothing that God hates more than sloth and laziness if God were to create a man and that man would to sit around and do [ __ ] all God will frown upon you it's why you're never lucky start to work start to show God the beauty of his own Creations you be amazed how lucky you'll become you load your own weakness you load your own laziness this is what all of these things are I don't feel depression how can I feel depression when on the most powerful version of me that I could ever [ __ ] be the most important thing obviously regarding anything you do in your life is your mindset we're going to learn something about ourselves and learn talk about how you how do you view the world how you view the world absolutely inly shapes how you react to the world world how you act in the world how people view you it's all down to how you view things there's very few things in this life we actually have any control over I've lived an extreme life more extreme than most I've been a multi-millionaire I've been a nobody I've been uh famous I've been a World level athlete i' I've started from nothing with the point where I had to run to the gym because I didn't even have a car to get there I've done it all so i' i' I've lived a very extreme life and this is where these lessons come from I told everyone I'm going to be world champion years before I even had a British title before I even had an English title I just started fighting I was like oh I'm the next World Champion yeah yeah and just just I just start saying it but I said it with genuine conviction I knew I would be the best good shot there from T he did say the second round water a crunching shots you have to understand that this world everyone constantly tells you do not be arrogant do not have an ego people will constantly tell you to not talk in a way which is full of conviction people do not like you to have be arrogant and have an ego this is the worst thing ever let me tell you a fact number one facet of a g mindset your life is never going to be worse if you walk through the world believing you are the [ __ ] man and I believe that I don't just say these things I [ __ ] believe them and when you go through life believing you really really are the man you're going to lose a few loser friends who cares what you are going to gain is other people on the same path you're going to gain other people think yeah well I'm the [ __ ] man too this guy's the man let make some money that's what's going to happen you need to start believing you are the [ __ ] man even if you're not the man yet even before I was world champion I knew I was going to be the man so I don't give a [ __ ] and I was happy to say that to anybody when people call me arrogant and stupid and deluded I just sit there look at them and say yeah [ __ ] you I'm going to be the man G mindset first thing you have to believe who the [ __ ] man you can achieve anything I'm not saying you can achieve anything easily I'm not saying it's not going to take a whole bunch of work I'm not saying it's going to happen quickly but you have to believe you can achieve anything tell you something now I don't give a [ __ ] up to being an astronaut I don't care about climbing Everest you give me enough time to train I will get it done I know that for a fact cuz I know who I am as a man you need to be perspicacious you need to understand that in this world there's a whole bunch of people doing amazing [ __ ] that you are not doing and that needs to piss you off because it pisses you off you become motivated all of a sudden I was the only one who was pissed off when that Aston Martin was next to me and I had my sales job I was the only one who was pissed off when I saw that Ferrari Drive pass other people were not annoyed by it and they're not annoyed by it they're not driven to Beat It you understand they're not driven to be where that person was I'm telling you to be angry anger is a fantastic Force you're a [ __ ] man you're a full grown man it's perfectly fine for you to be pissed off it's perfectly fine for you to look around at your life look at the girl you're [ __ ] look at the house you live in look at the car you drive and get pissed off and go you know what I want a hotter [ __ ] I want a [ __ ] nicer house I want a faster car there's nothing wrong if you take that anger and you direct it in the correct direction this is the reason I stop fighting now people go why do you stop fighting us cuz I fought and I went through hell to get everything I now have I had nothing when I fought I had nothing and I wanted the life I now have now I wake up in one of my three mansions with one of my seven super cars and one of my 15 women what do I need to fight for now people have different motivations for different things so some Fighters out there who fight for other reasons you know but my motivation was I was pissed off at the world you look around you and you don't own the home you're in get pissed off if there ain't a Ferrari on your drive get pissed off if you don't have 10 Playboy Bunny level Beauties get p pissed off you need to sit there and realize whoa whoa whoa I have a few years of Consciousness and even less than that I have a few short years as a young man because age will damage you if you're a millionaire when you're 60 is not nearly as good as being a millionaire at my age you need to realize you got a few short years as a young man you're [ __ ] wasting it you need to sit there and go [ __ ] [ __ ] get angry cuz getting angry forced directed anger is an extremely powerful force nobody absolutely nobody gives a [ __ ] about you as as much as you're going to have to give a [ __ ] about yourself nobody cares about you as much as they need to care to fix your life you are never going to have any of the things you want if you do not get them yourself only person who gives a [ __ ] about your life truly is you and if you don't give a [ __ ] then you're [ __ ] have to understand you are out here alone absolutely alone and when you understand these three things you start to see how a mindset comes together nobody's going to save you you're [ __ ] it's totally down to you you're pissed off with your current situation and you want to change it plus you believe you can do absolutely anything this is how I thought at 18 years old this is how I achieved so much in the short years this is how I went from a nobody to a World level athlete and a multi-millionaire because at a very young age when I had my Prime resource of energy and power 18 19 years old I understood those three tenants I believe I can do anything I'm pissed off I don't have the life I want and nobody else is going to give it to me these are three things you need to understand if any one of these elements is missing you'll never have the right mindset the G mindset will never formulate if any one of these elements is missing all three are absolutely essential and the sooner you get your act together the sooner you start to panic and worry and be concerned that you're 24 25 you're not [ __ ] Rich yet there's 24 and 25 year olds out there who are multi-millionaires [ __ ] the hot models these Instagram girls with 3 million followers they're getting [ __ ] by someone and it ain't you and that needs to piss you off you need to get concerned you get worried you [ __ ] I'm running out of time you need to get some urgency in your life so I became a Sayer so my brother said you've become a serer and what that means is I made a pack to him that my word was unbreakable strength and honor and that if I said something I meant it so I'd wake up in the morning I'd say to my brother I'm doing a thousand press UPS today once I said it once I spoke it it's like like a genie it became true if I said I was going to do a th press UPS I'd do them because if I didn't do them I'd feel guilty in myself that I was the kind of person who talks [ __ ] CU When You instill these mindsets when you when your mindset changes you start to be extremely accountable for yourself no one's coming to save you you become extremely accountable so when you realize that your word is one of the few things you have on this planet if you say things you're going to start sticking to them so then it becomes very easy to train you say I'm going to train every day this week I'm going train for two hours a day soon as you said it it's basically done if I say something basically done it's it's set in stone and this is another thing you don't understand with the G mindset you'd be very very specific with what you say because if you instill your mindset correctly and you start to just say things just start saying things then you hold yourself accountable say things you don't even think you want to do wake up and go up to your friend or your mom or whoever and say you know what I'm going to do a thousand push-ups today say it to people they're going to say no you're not so watch me and then you have a choice you're either going to succeed like a g or going to be a little [ __ ] and you're going to quit at 310 because it's hard what kind of man are you that's a decision you need to make this is another facet of the G mindset your word word has to be Iron unbreakable you have to start meaning every word you speak you say to someone I'm going to get rich you better [ __ ] do it otherwise you're a liar you're a liar and you're a little [ __ ] you say I'm going to put some muscle on you better [ __ ] do it you say I'm going to lift this weight you better [ __ ] do it 99% of the people out here talk [ __ ] they say things they half mean or things they don't mean if I say something I [ __ ] mean it once you implement that correctly then you get the ability to motivate yourself to no end get unlimited motivation cuz all you have to do is find the energy to say it it's literally that easy this is the fourth tenant and one of the most important ones because that is the power to unlimited motivation and that's the power to be taken seriously across all spheres of your life be specific with your language they sound like simple things but to implement them correctly truly and correctly in your mind will change your entire view of the world when you implement these four things correctly when you say if I say something I'm going to do it my word is Iron Will and you say that nobody is ever coming to save me ever and you say that I'm pissed off I don't have the life I want to have and you couple that with I believe I can do anything if you truly believe all of these four things it's going to change your entire view of this planet when my for my most famous tweets when I said depression wasn't real I was having arguments with all these people and everyone's telling me how how dangerous my mindset is what is dangerous about believing that you control your own mind you need to live like God is always watching you may have the opportunity to do something bad or you may have the opportunity to steal some money or snake somebody but in the end you're going to pay for that and the bill will be paid I think if you do the right thing in my experience if you're a person who does the right thing firm handshake is on time doesn't lie to anybody does what he's supposed to do is honest with a good heart is genuinely polite to everyone he meets if you are that person you get very far in life I have I've yet to meet people who just do all the simple things right who completely fail at life but I've met a lot of people who snake or steal some money and they get really riched and lose it all or they get rich and end up a gambling addict or depressed or Etc so you have to just understand that God is always watching he's going to reward you in the end that's the first thing and the second thing I will say is that you are the sum of The Five People You spend the most time with and you need to create your reality I think the biggest problem with young people today is that they don't create their realities heavily enough the people that they want to spend most time with aren't adding any value to their lives and then they end up wondering why they don't get here when I tell people that you are the sum of The Five People You spend the most time time with everyone agrees they go yeah that's probably true people The Five People You spend the most time with that's what you're going to end up like they say yeah that's true and then they continue to hang around with people who they don't want to be why you have there has to be a point there has to be a point where you sit and go okay you're my friends etc etc I love you guys yeah we can talk whatever but I'm on a different life path you have to leave some people behind if you were to come hang out with me and you were in a room with me and my five friends you'd feel you'd feel self-conscious you're right you don't feel self with your friends if you were to come hang around with me and my crew you would be self-conscious and that self-consciousness would motivate you or they would certainly instill the discipline required for you to change you don't feel self-conscious amongst your peers that's why you don't change if you were to get in a room and you're the only person who ain't aing monster you'd want to become a monster if you walk through life feel like you have nothing to prove here if you wake up each day and go I don't owe anybody anything I don't have to prove anything to anybody then you are a loser because you are absolutely not the incorrect you must prove yourself to other people you must prove yourself to your bloodline you must prove yourself to God God hates the lazy you can't stand them if he gives you all these genetic dispositions and these natural god-given gifts if you have two arms and two legs and you can think and you're not trying your absolute best that's the reason you're not lucky he doesn't like you he likes the people which show him the beauty of his own creation he likes to give somebody building blocks and them to build something amazing it's the best thing about being a man you have to build who you are God loves to see that those people for some reason seem to be enormously lucky right the person who goes I don't have to prove anything to God I don't owe all of my ancestors any effort you know for 5,000 years people were dodging saber tooth tigers and catching the plague and running from genas Khan just for my stupid to be born I don't owe them anything don't owe them a thing because I want to play video games these people are losers you should walk through Earth with Force inside of you if I walk as I walked into this hotel everybody not because they know who I am but because as I move even it even if it's behind their head people feel something it's it's an energy that comes from brutal competence that's what happens when a predator walks in a room you pay attention next time you're in a restaurant if a man who's truly dangerous walks in nearly every other man kind of looks up at the same time feel it need to or you don't survive we've evolved with that to live that's who I am I couldn't imagine not being that man I've done that because I've been trying to prove myself to my lineage my entire life I wake up every day with something to I have hundreds of millions of dollars I wake up and think more I'm in fantastic shape four times world champion fighting The Matrix out here by myself more I will have to be braver I must try harder all I do is prove myself so when I hear people go I don't have nothing to prove then you're a loser peasants have never felt like they needed to prove anything but Kings felt like they needed to go and Conquer land isn't that Co it's coincidential that the king who already had it all felt like he needed to go to some far-flung land and Conquer it and take it and prove he's the king but the peasants oh I don't have to prove nothing to nobody you're a loser then you're a dummy I absolutely and utterly completely have everything to prove to everybody all of the time that's who I am I will prove anything to anybody if I sit and say x I will prove it to anyone I can be checked anytime and their ancestors who fought in saber-tooth tigers or escaped the the Mongol hordes or managed to dodge bombs in the second world war all the they went through just for this keton to be born and to look at him look at who he is listen to his life story listen to what he does on a day-to-day basis and they would feel nothing but shame your ancestors did all that all that struggling to survive hunter hunting and Gathering avoiding enemies anything it took dying at age 30 from a tooth infection all the crap they went through just for you to be born so you could smoke weed and jack off that's what your ancestors died for that's what they work so hard for that's who you are that's the end of youring bloodline do you feel no shame it'sing shameful my ancestors will look at me and think everything we went through was worth it your ancestors will look at most of these people their ancestors look at them and feel nothing but disgust well I guarantee even their living relatives their living parents aren't even proud of them like the your own father's ashamed of you and you don't even feel motivated to do it's a shame if you were to go and look your father in the eye and said you know what I could have been aing I could have been a UFC champion I could have been ult M millionaire could have been a race car driver could have been nuclear physicist could have done all these things but I was busy on you think he's going to be proud of you no no and and there's men here who will deny it right there's men who will go no no no no but those are the ones who are most lost and they should look in the mirror look deep in their own eyes and say yes I'm disgusting I can change this that's the beauty about being a man if you're disgusting you can change it that's the beauty there's nothing stopping you changing it right you must accept you must accept it first most of these people what they do is they hang around with other disgusting people and then there're a little group of disgusting people and they think well I'm not disgusting everyone's disgusting and this is normal it's normal to be a off not in my world it isn't it's not it's not it's not normal to be a jerk off in my world it's the things it's the denial that's going to hold you back the most the people who go yes I'm wasting my potential those are the ones who have potential the ones who stand up and go I am wasting my potential I could be anything and I am not that yet they have a chance The Men Who go well no actually I'm fine they're they're inside the Matrix fully slave minded they're a waste of time but if you sit there and go you know what yeah I am wasting my potential yes I can be more than I am even if I'm already great I can be better as good as I am I still I still push myself to the Limit every single day I have every single thing a man could Poss want I'm still pushing myself this is your prerogative as a man you need to be instilled with a sense of duty duty to your bloodline you must want it you need to want it deep inside your soul I can't die as anything less than Emperor it's it's my destiny there are duties that men must fulfill whether to God or to your bloodline if I feel extremely happy and excited I'm going to use that as motivation or energy to do amazing things and do good and work hard if I feel absolutely depressed and distraught I'm going to use that as endless energy and motivation to do amazing things and work hard it doesn't matter what you give me energy cannot be destroyed it can only be converted and transferred it doesn't matter what fuel you give me you give me diesel petrol kerosene vodka doesn't matter what you put inside of my engine hardw is going to come out absolutely that's all I know how how to do making the best move on the chess board regardless of how losing your position is is a life philosophy that most will never understand sometimes you look at your position on the board and your but still regardless of how you are there is still a best move there's always a best move and a worst move no matter how bad things are many people when they get to a losing position think ah it doesn't matter I don't have to make the best move anymore I actually disagree maybe nine times out of 10 the best move won't save you but that one time out of 10 the best move might be just enough to save your on a long enough time frame if you play the game repeatedly day after day taking risks always making the best move regardless of whether you're winning or losing it will compound into an upward spiral of NeverEnding success you might end up somewhere near me you might have dinner one day you might stop being a broki might stop being a loser if your girl leaves you the best move on the board perhaps is to go to the gym perhaps is to send her flowers perhaps is to never text her again but you should make the best move on the board regardless even if you don't want her back you should still make the best move you should always think that way what move will give me the best possible strategic position that's how you think that's how I think best move on the board is how you should approach your life next time you're in a situation you should sit and say okay this is a bad situation I'm what the best move I could possibly make what's the outcome I would like what's the most likely move to give me that particular out and you'll be surprised what some of them are I had a guy emailed me the other day saying he lost his job he was the worst salesman well then you deserve to lose your job that's how sales works it's it's Fierce goes well I don't know what should I do I said what's the best move on the board he goes well I really want want the sales job I think I can get good at it I said well then work for free so do you have another job yet he said no okay while you're applying for other jobs instead of sitting around your on your at home keep working for free for the company for two or 3 weeks and see if you can turn it around and he tried that and he couldn't cuz he [ __ ] at sales but the point is if he would have sat at home doing nothing it wouldn't have helped him the best move on the board was to try and prove to his company that he's actually worth something if he was worth something in those two or three weeks he might have turned around and got his job back he still got to apply for new jobs he didn't lose anything that's Mo with the chess board that's how I want you to approach your life ladies and gentlemen it's the mental model in which you should apply to scenarios to deduce what is the best possible action because if you're always making the best move and very rarely making the worst move it's pretty hard to lose it's player versus player out here the world is about winners and losers and everyone is competing against each other you are competing against me I'm competing against you you're competing against your friend you and you're competing against your enemies you want a dollar so does everyone else you want that hot girl so does everyone else want that house so does everyone else what's amazing is the things you want the main reason you want them is cuz other people want them so you can show off that you have it and they don't it is competition kind of like the age old adage if a tiger is chasing 10 people you don't have to be the fastest you just have to be faster than the slowest guy cuz he's [ __ ] so considering that a lot of people are constantly making the wrong moves if you can just start to make the Right Moves most of the time you'll see exactly how easy life can be I don't even want your energy around me because quitters are the worst people on the planet you you can give a quitter absolutely everything and they will still fail you can give a it doesn't matter what it is if you go to Ikea and buy a flat packing table and put it in front of a quitter you will never have a table he'll look at it it's just long and he'll quit quitters can have every single Advantage quitters can have all the information quitters can have all the tooth quitters can have a mentorship quitters can have someone who messages them every morning hey bro let's get it and guess what they're going to do at the end quit quit they ain't never going to have so if you're a quitter I don't even want you even inside my organization I don't want quitters anywhere near me cuz you're never going to be successful people say hey man you need to find your what you're passionate about and do that and what they're trying to say is only do what you like because you have no motivation to do anything else but I'm going to sit here and once again explain to you how different the world is when you have a mind which isn't warped and affected easily by outside influences you are never going to become a robot this is nothing to do with not feeling emotions there nothing to do with just becoming an empty emotionless void of a person that's not what they say is this is about understanding that you're a human being you're going to feel emotions this is a beautiful thing and making sure that you use them in the correct way A and B you do not ever let them stop you doing what you're supposed to do I say to people often I haven't felt like going to the gym in 2 years I'm wearing my gym clothes right now I just finished training I haven't felt like training in 2 years I after 10 years of professional fighting after giving my life to exercise genuinely I have not woke up and felt like oh I really want to train I haven't felt that way in a long time that's why I retired from fighting but I have still gone and I have still trained regardless of how I feel so this is one of the tenants and there's going to be a lot of things you're going to learn of an iron mindset the ability to not let your feelings affect you and sometimes to do the complete opposite of how you feel because you're not going to very often feel like working hard you're not going to always feel like doing the right thing you're not always going to be motivated the idea that you need to be constantly motivated shows how weak your mindset is I don't need motivation to go to the gym I can not want to go with every fiber of my being and I will still be there because I use my cerebral ability I use my mind and I logically decide what I'm going to do with my day regardless of how I feel regardless of whether I'm motivated or not because that's all life is that's all the world is life is just getting things done doing the right things doing the important things making sure they're done efficiently and thoroughly so that you live the best possible life it's as simple as that it's not particularly complicated I'm not going to be and I don't want to be one of those guys who's like motivation inspiration I've never been one of them people I don't believe in motivation inspiration I don't believe in that crap I don't believe that you need motivation to get things done I'm not going to sit here and just talk a whole bunch of motivational things to make you feel good what I'm going to do is I'm going to tell you the things I always did that allowed me to put together the mindset I currently have so if you look at any story literally any story with a hero in it they all have one thing in common and that thing is that there's always a villain you cannot have a hero without a villain it doesn't matter you can think of any superhero any comic book book any any book you can think of any movie there's always a good guy and there's a bad guy so for the good guy to exist there has to be a bad guy there's no other way for the duality of the universe to continue without this basic tent so you want to be the good guy in your story you want and in every I've said this before actually as a man life is going to be difficult it's more difficult than being a woman it's more difficult than anything else so it's very easy to see yourself life is actually easier as a whole if you see yourself as a hero cuz in every single hero story the hero suffers he has hard time and if you understand that you're suffering because you're a hero then the suffering begins to make sense so you can be sitting here right now going my woman doesn't respect me I have no money in the bank this is difficult I I'm struggling here I'm struggling there you can feel sorry for yourself or you can say yeah my woman doesn't respect me I'm struggling I can't make money but you know what that's that's cuz I'm a superhero and my life's going to be hard cuz I'm a man and as a hero it's going to be difficult these are the tests and the trials and tribulations I have to go through to become someone every single male superhero went through a whole ton of before he became superhero you've seen the Batman movies he his parents died he was he was locked up in jail all these bad things happen and then they emerge as a hero and this is done for a reason because it's the reality of life especially as a man so right now you have to understand that you're the hero in this movie and if you're struggling you're struggling for a very important reason and how you handle these struggles and how you deal with these struggles going to decide the kind of person you're going to be afterwards you're either going to be a superhero or you're going to succumb to them and you're going to fail so be happy that you're struggling because that's important that's the first thing second thing is there has to be a villain now most people think their villain is someone else you see this all the time the villain is the opposite of the hero so if you're sitting at home and you haven't got much money and you're and you're broke and you're pissed off and you're depressed and you look at me and I have four supercars and all these girls I'm traveling the world I Go Everywhere I want you may think I'm your villain people look at other people and say a that guy has this this guy has this and they become envious they think that's the villain that's not true that's not the case because every single person it has different circumstances there are things you have that I don't have and there's things I have that you don't have so I may have had a genetic gift over you for example cuz I'm a a fantastic kickboxer but you may have been born more wealthy than me I was born in a very very poor family so I had advantages and disadvantages you had advantages and disadvantages so comparing yourself to other people is is asinine and it's aain because it's not a level Fair playing Ground there are some people who are born to millionaire parents who are gorgeous model goodlooking and have six-packs without trying some people are lucky like that that's just how it is so comparing yourself to these people is not going to help you your villain is nobody else your villain is someone you're going to create and you're going to create your villain because he's going to motivate you to be the most powerful hero you can possibly be so you're going to create your villain and this is the task for the first week this is a six- week training course and over each week you have a very important task and the task for this week is to create your villain to make sure that there was no disadvantages involved your villain's going to be a clone of you but what your villain's going to have is he's going to have some things you don't have and your villain is going to be the person who basically without requirement for motivation without requirement without being no matter how he feels that day no matter how stressed he is from work regardless of what happens to him your villain's going to be the guy who always does exactly what he wants to do so your villain's going to be the guy who goes to the gym regardless of how he feels your villain's going to be the guy who approaches every beautiful girl he ever sees and says hey I I really think you're beautiful goes overt and talks to your villain's going to be the guy who asks for a Razor your villain's going to be the guy who does everything he wants regardless of how he feels regardless if he's not motivated or not regardless if he's shy to talk to that girl or people are watching or his ankle hurts he doesn't want to go to the gym whatever or his boss is he thinks his boss is going to fire him the villain is that dude who does anything he wants to do you have to sit and you have to make a list of all the things you sit there and say if I did everything I wanted to do if I were to be the best version of myself possible what would I do okay well i' go to the gym every day I get up at 6:00 a.m. and i' go to the gym every day you write that down my villain is the kind of guy who reads very important books I'm I I say I don't have time but my enemy this villain he reads books he finds time he doesn't watch TV ever he doesn't waste time ever he doesn't eat junk food he reads books right to that you need to make a list now this list at first should be easy for you but then you're going to get to about seven or eight things you're going to stop no this list needs to be 25 to 30 points long minimum this guy you're building your arch nemesis you have to write down every single quality about this guy what he does he goes to the gym every day 6:00 a.m. he doesn't watch TV he doesn't eat junk food he goes up to beautiful girls set c c of 25 are 30 points long because this is going to become your enemy for the next 6 weeks train you want to become a hero you need someone to battle against this is who you're battling against you're battling against a better version of yourself a version of yourself that doesn't succumb to how he feels but does what he's supposed to do anyway so this is who your villain's going to be and when you're writing down this list all the qualities your villain has imagine what this person looks like you have to put genuine effort into this you have to imagine what he looks like imagine how he walks imagine how he talks imagine what people think when they see him imagine how different you would be if you had been going to the gym every single day for an hour and a half every single day for the last 2 3 4 years imagine it imagine how differently people would look at you imagine how differently females would treat you if you were Jack like that guy would be you have to sit and you have to put down all these qualities and then once the qualities Are there 25 or 30 minimum then you have to imagine what kind of person is is you have to imagine what he looks like what he talks like what he thinks like imagine how he views the world cuz this is who you're going to be battling and against so you have to put genuine effort into constructing this person and understanding this person the reason I'm saying do this is because this is what motivates me every single day when I was training for a fight the reason I'd always go train is cuz I knew my enemy was training but when I stopped fighting professionally I thought well I what enemy do I have and I realized I had to create my own so when I don't feel like going I imagine I've built my own enemy I want even list all the things that my enemy has he has a whole bunch of I don't have and he's a he' be an impossible nearly impossible person to be but when I sit and I don't feel like going to the gym I know my enemy is training cuz he trains no matter what regardless of how he feels regardless if he's pissed off or if there's traffic or it's raining or he's tired my enemy trains when I see a girl and she's beautiful but all our friends there I'm afraid been laugh at me my enemy wouldn't give a You' go over there anyway that's who he is he's a man so when I understood who I was truly battling against then you have two choices you either rise up to try and take him on or you become a little [ __ ] you have the choice do I want to lose to this man this man I've created and I've built do I want to lose to him or do I want to beat him or compete with him and you have to make a choice and you sit there and go well I know that the person I created in my mind my my arch nemesis would go over there and he talk to all the girls I need two of them let alone one this is an extremely important facet and for the next 6 weeks we going be doing lots of things that are going to revert back to the enemy that you've created so you have to put genuine effort into putting together this person you have to imagin everything about them from start to finish you have to imagin standing next to them if you were standing next to this guy right now with no shirt on who would girls want to who would people respect and the crazy thing about all of this is that this person is you this person is you it's just you with a little bit of a different path or a different take on life it's you who's the person who does whatever he's supposed to do regardless of how he feels it's you with an iron mind this is the exact point the reason creating this enemy is so important and the reason viewing how he viewing him and seeing how he sees the world and and understanding how important and Powerful this person is important is because that person is you that person is you who does what he's supposed to do without fail that's all it is and when you truly truly put this person together and you truly truly understand it and you find out what you could be and you find out what you're battling against you're going to become far more difficult to demotivate it's going to be much harder for someone to say to you don't go to the gym because you're going to know well my Oppo my enemy this guy give him a name whatever this dude's going to the gym that's why he looks how he looks and that's who I'm being being compared to so I have to go to the gym oh yeah but you know I'm tired well you don't go then my training part doesn't want to go fine you don't go I am going I'm not the guy who's going to let this man beat me and you have to start comparing yourself to this guy in every single facet I still do it to this day I compare my bank balance to this guys and he's killing me I compare my body to this guys he's killing me I compare so many things about myself you guys may look at me and go take millionaire girls this that that I'm still comparing myself to this person I've created and I know that I'm losing and that's what drives me forward that's why I don't miss the gym that's how I find a way to make money that's how I do whatever it takes to succeed because I know who I'm battling against most you guys have no enemy you have no enemy or you have an enemy which is somebody else you're looking at Justin Bieber or Drake or something that that's not going to motivate you that's pointless it's not going to help you or you have no enemy at all you have a support structure around you and you have people say oh you're great just the way you are you know you're beautiful just the way you are and you're sitting there living in your little comfort zone a little [ __ ] put this enemy together from start to finish and truly put this list together you truly create this person and truly understand that it could be you it's going to be far more difficult to stop you doing what you need to do in the future you can give a quitter absolutely everything and they will still fail you can give a it doesn't matter what it is if you go to Ikea and buy a flat pack table and put it in front of a quitter you will never have a table he'll look at it long and he'll quit quitters can have every single Advantage quitters can have all the information quitters can have all the toage quitters can have a mentorship quitters can have someone who messages them every morning hey bro let's get it and guess what they're going to do at the end quit quit they ain't never going to have so if you're a quitter I don't even want you even inside my organization I don't want quitters anywhere near me because you're never going to be successful there's a lot of young men now young women that require that discipline what kind of advice would you give them practical advice yeah I think that you have to live there's a lot of practical advice I can give in terms of the religious sense I would say you need to live like God is always watching you may have the opportunity to do something bad or you may have to steal some money or snake somebody but in the end you're going to pay for that and the bill will be paid I think if you do the right thing in my experience if you're a person who does the right thing firm handshake is on time doesn't lie to anybody does what he's supposed to do is honest with a good heart is genuinely polite to everyone he meets if you are that person you get very far in life I have I've yet to meet people who just do all the simple things right who completely fail at life but I've met a lot of people who snake or steal some money and they get really rich then they lose it all or they get rich and end up a gambling addict or depressed or Etc if you want a good Society so then you have to argue and sit and say do these people want a happy functioning Society or do they want something else I live I have to live the exact same life regardless of how I feel so me for me happiness is not a good indicator on how life should be lived you shouldn't wake up and say how happy am I today how does that affect how I act that's not how I operate I wake up and say what must be done what will allow me to be proud of myself what will allow me to achieve and those things will be done regard of how I feel and those are how that's how the most successful people on Earth all operate the most successful people on Earth don't only do things because they feel happy about doing them for whole world doesn't give a [ __ ] if men are happy or not nobody cares about men being happy we talk about women being happy we want children to be happy if you look at a full- grown man on Christmas morning he's smiling because his wife is smiling he's smiling because his children are smiling nobody even buys him anything what do they buy the dad socks nobody cares about men being happy so why do you as a man care about you being happy that's how you're going to fall into these traps I'm a very I'm a very content person I live a fantastic life I'm not miserable or depressed I'm not sad ever but I don't wake up and go I want to be happy today no sir I wake up and say okay things must be done and those things will be completed regardless of how I feel regardless of how I feel you can lock me in a dungeon for an unknown amount of time in a ROM in Romania and I will still complete as many push-ups as I can possibly do in the dark by myself what else am I going to do sit there and be sad happy or sad push up must be done it's called Duty it's called honor it's called Pride if you had these things you would never do dumb [ __ ] in the first place so you have to just understand that God is always watching he's going to reward you in the end that's the first thing and the second thing I will say is that you are the sum of The Five People You spend the most time with and you need to create your reality I think the biggest problem with young people today is that they don't create their realities heavily enough the people that they want to spend most time with aren't adding any value to their lives and then they end up wondering why they don't get I stand in the mirror with a pure heart I know I am the best version of me that could possibly ever exist I know that God is proud of me there's nothing that God hates more than sloth and laziness if God were to create a man and that man were to sit around and do [ __ ] all God will frown upon you it's why you're never lucky if you're listening to this and you think I'm never lucky I'll tell you why cuz God dislikes you because you're [ __ ] lazy start to work start to show God the beauty of his own Creations you'd be amazed how lucky you can come wow God is unhappy with these people and inside their hearts they're unhappy we talk about depression anxiety all those things you mentioned in the earlier on this podcast that comes from self-loathing you load your own weakness you load your own laziness this is what all of these things are it's so easy to win if you can control your own mind the seems that nobody [ __ ] can if you cannot control your own mind then you are just a feather in the Wind of life because your own mind is the only thing you can control you can't control the weather you can't control other people people you can't even control whether your heart stops beating you might have a heart attack tomorrow you can't control anything besides what you think if you cannot control your own mind then you go through life with zero control zero influence you can't control anything you're just a feather in the wind waiting for life to blow you from happy place to sad place to happy place to sad Place completely hoping on the gods to be fortunate to you because if any genuine discomfort comes your way you're [ __ ] it is trained like everything else in life it is trained so if you find yourself not appreciating what you have until it's gone then you must blink and cure your brain if you find yourself unable to focus or concentrate on tasks you must blink and cure your brain if you find yourself unable to go and dedicate yourself to something you don't want to do you must blink and cure your brain in the world we live in today it's hyper competitive and if you want to be the kind of man that has the choice of women to choose a good one you need to be an excellent man it's no longer acceptable for you to just be an average Joe or below average you have to get up and you have to work hard and you have to be smart and interesting and you have to be charismatic and make some money and be in good shape and you have to try very hard genuine masculinity is not out here to hurt absolutely the opposite it's out here to protect and when bad things happen they call traditionally masculine men you need a firefighter them you need a masculine man when you call the police because of the problem you had you want masculine men and as soon as a woman or a man is in trouble when you look for backup you look for masculine men and masculine men have a duty to provide and protect those they care about we have a duty to do things we don't feel like doing because we know we're supposed to do them and that's why we stayed in the Titanic and died those were masculine men Life as a man is exceptionally difficult I say the most beautiful and the most terrifying thing about being a man is you're born without value Society doesn't care about you you're only going to be cared about based on how useful you are you have the chance to build yourself up and become a super hero if you're prepared to do the hard work and be indeseable enough to never quit but if you're going to stand around and wait for a handout nobody's going to ever respect you and I think that a lot of people have forgotten about how difficult how competitive it is as a man we're always in constant competition with each other and it's your duty as a man to stand up and say I want to be as important and strong and good-hearted and God-fearing as possible and I need to work hard to achieve those things look at it that's how life should be you should have a duty to your ancestors I was instilled with a duty for a very long time to honor my ancestors to achieve and I was told from a very young age that the only thing your ancestors are interested in is achievement even to this day when I do podcasts people repeat and talk about my father if I wasn't successful he wouldn't be spoken about him he Lo he died 9 years ago and he was a good chess but no one's really that interested iness the reason he lives on is because I'm so monumentally successful that people are interested in my origin story he is mentioned the reason I will live forever is because my son will be so monumentally successful that they'll talk about how he could have been such a perfect specimen of Man how he was raised and they will mention me if you give a [ __ ] about your ancestry and if you give a [ __ ] about your family and you're not a selfish person and you want them to exist out in The Ether for reality for for The Eternity of reality it is your duty to be successful a traditionally masculine man does things he doesn't feel like doing because it is his duty to do them he charges into the bur building because it is his duty not because he feels like it because it is his duty men who do not control their emotions are dangerous if you find a man who is stoic he's not going to hurt people he's going to sit and think about his actions very carefully and he's going to be a good man who protects for and provides for his family you find a man who just acts out on impulse and does whatever he feels like you're going to find a dangerous man you need to be teaching stoicism you to be teaching young men to understand that the world is very very difficult it's hard to be a man you're going to feel bad sometimes you just suck it up and perform anyway not to sit there you cry your eyes out this is what God wants from us from all of us it doesn't matter what the adversary is it doesn't matter how much you're hurt by it you need to allow it to motivate you to push harder and and show your power um and show your resilience I very much understood that when bad things happen to me this is a lesson from the universe or from God or from the Creator to to to stand up and show who I am and who I can be and to take all of the pain and anguish and disappointment and heartbreak and all of this and turn it into a force I can use for good and to make myself a better person and I think if you don't approach life this way that you're always going to struggle cuz life is hard for everybody it's going to be hard it doesn't matter who you are or what you do you need to be resilient to it just any man who's out there in the world today you need to look at some problems that need solving either for yourself or for society and find a way to fix them and I think that you should just adopt some problems and try and fix them it doesn't matter what it is you can just try and fix the litter in your area or you can try and get a six-pack or whatever you want so if you love your family and you love your last name and you're proud of yourself then you have a duty to be massively monumentally successful to show homage to your ancestors I find it amazing there are people out here today who are going to sit and say oh I'm sad I'm too depressed I don't want to work hard there do you understand that only 200 years ago there were peasants out working a field starving surviving the Black Death surviving the plague struggling to exist just to reproduce so that 200 years later you can be the end of their bloodline for you to sit on your ass and do [ __ ] nothing like you're a [ __ ] up you're [ __ ] up your entire bloodline of your entire ancestry you owe these people things you must they went through hell for you to exist you have a debt you have a duty to pay you have to be the best possible version of yourself and the same to God God loves people who try God loves people who work hard it's amazing if you try your very best all the time what God will give you he'll give it to you anything you want if you actually try not not convincing yourself you try actually try they're different things disappearing from society it used to be like I am Andrew son of Emory it was all about who you're son of right and it's all Vanishing now but you have a legacy you can build and and I I love the fact that when I was growing up when my dad walked into a chess tournament people were scared because his name was said and they were fearful of his last name and now people are fearful of the last name again because of me and they will be again because of my son and this is this is the beauty of Life as a man and one of the most terrifying but also gratifying things of of Life as a man is that we're all born relatively valous I don't think women are born that way a woman if she's born especially if she's attractive has an innate value people just want her no matter what but as a man if you're not an important man nobody gives a [ __ ] about you and they're never going to care so you have to build yourself from the ground up and that's scary for a lot of people but it's also a massive opportunity you can decide if you want to be a famous musician or a nice sensitive poet or a painter or a kickboxing world champion or a businessman you get to decide on all the different characters in the video game you can choose who do I want to be and then if you actually try actually try you can become it isn't that amazing you can wake up and go you know what I want to be this kind of guy I knew who I want to be I want to be the dude pulling up in the lambo 3 in the morning gets out everyone's like who is this big strong Rich dude I want to be that man so I became in and and if you don't want that if you want to go be a a musician and play guitar and get a bunch of chicks and chill and Bali and smoke wheat whatever go you can choose your character and build it and there's also some Universal constants like if you a lot of people don't have the ability to understand the compounding effect of doing the right thing time after time even if you start a new business you don't know what to do I guarant guantee if you're always on time if you're a builder and you're always on time take the basic [ __ ] just be on time over time you may you may think oh I've just on time no one notices trust me across 10 years that's the difference between being a successful Builder and not being a successful Builder stick to the absolute Basics and and do the right thing and do know what you're supposed to do and this is why I have so little sympathy for people who go I'm trying to make it and I can't because I think they're lying to me and they're lying to themselves they got a lot of emails a lot of messages and a lot of people like bro I'm trying my best and my answer is simply no you're not I I really don't think they're trying to best I maybe I come across and I seem non-sympathetic but I'm from a council state in Luton I'm now a billionaire and it's because I actually tried my best a a lazy person thinks he's working too hard and a successful person thinks he isn't working hard enough and we're doing 20 times the work they are and we're like I could have done more could have done this I missed that today can't miss that again I should have taken that call I should have flown there I should have that's you know we have guilt about it they don't give a solitary [ __ ] and even if you pointed it out to them they'd sit there and go oh yeah and they'd make some excuse for it it's it's it's the brutal arrogance of people it's like if you're not going to take any action at all after 2 hours of being educated then you're going to just stay a loser yeah 100% that's the reality there's nothing that God hates more than sloth and laziness if God were to create a man and that man were to sit around and do [ __ ] all God will frown upon you it's why you're never lucky my life is GTA I don't need to play a game for GTA if I want a gun I'll [ __ ] buy it but want car I'll [ __ ] buy it I want [ __ ] I'll get her it's me I am GTA I find it amazing that people will sit there and spend all their time upgrading that character making as much money as they can getting the best guns getting strong getting some hoes meeting important people getting the best car they'll do all that in a game but they won't do it in real life I I find that incredible I don't see why people play the games they play the games because they're scared of loss because if you die in the game you get another chance if you lose in the game you get another chance in life you get one shot damn that's but if you get some balls if you get some balls that's what life is as a game that's what life is as a man this is one big video game game you get to upgrade your character you're not born with any value all these women that you just put me on with are born with value they're pretty already they're gorgeous already they're good-looking enough even if they're a five someone's going to give a [ __ ] they exist because someone wants to [ __ ] them as a man if you don't make yourself valuable you have no value you have to get up and do it just like a video game you start with [ __ ] zero you have to decide if you want to complete it you have to upgrade your character so I find it amazing that men are going to play video games and [ __ ] about and waste their time instead of upgrading their character everyone knows what to do you know what you have to do right if you had to become the most dangerous intelligent respectable man on the planet you know you're supposed to go to the gym you know you're supposed to train learn how to fight you know you know all these things you don't do them that's your that's your decision it's your prerogative I didn't I didn't make that choice I made the choice to do it all I decided all of it and every single man watching this can do the exact same thing I can't stand quitters so if you're going to kind of person who's going to quit because it's hard I don't even want your energy around me cuz quitters are the worst people on the planet you can give a quitter absolutely everything and they will still fail quitters can have every single Advantage quitters can have all the information quitters can have all the toage quitters can have a mentorship quitters can have someone who messages them every morning hey bro let's get it and guess what they're going to do at the end quit quit they ain't never going to have [ __ ] right you need the people who don't quit I don't quit I suffered when you did so you are not my equal because you decided not to suffer you have enjoyed Comfort when I haven't and that's fine but don't expect me to look at you as my equal cuz you're not I'll snap your [ __ ] neck when I tell people people that you are the sum of The Five People You spend the most time with everyone agrees they go yeah that's probably true the People The Five People You spend the most time with that's what you're going to end up like they say yeah that's true and then they continue to hang around with people who they don't want to be why you have there has to be a point there has to be a point where you sit and go okay you're my friends etc etc I love you guys yeah we can talk whatever but I'm on a different life path you have to leave some people behind you wouldn't want to be if you were to come hang out with me and you were in a room with me and my five friends you'd feel you'd feel self-conscious I'm with Killers we're [ __ ] monsters if you were to come hang around with me and my crew you would be self-conscious and that self-consciousness would motivate you or they would certainly instill the discipline required for you to change you don't feel self-conscious amongst your peers that's why you don't change the people who come along talk about passive income they sound like quitters they like people who don't want to work you have to just work some point you have to bite the bullet and just work so when someone comes to me talk about passive income and they're Brokey I'm like you are just lazy you are lazy you will never get anywhere lazy people never get anywhere in life doesn't matter what it matter tennis or money you're lazy you're never going to get if we were still in the animal kingdom the lions that you see on TV they weren't just born big lions they had to fight other Lions they had to fight to get that antelope they had to fight other animals hyenas jackals they had to fight to be the boss we liveing in a comfortable world now where people think oh it doesn't matter it doesn't matter but you know what to some degree it does matter it does matter and I'm tell you who it matters to it matters to your soul and it matters to God there's nothing that God hates more than sloth and laziness if God were to create a a man and that man were to sit around and do [ __ ] all God will frown upon you it's why you're never lucky if you're listening to this and you think I'm never lucky I'll tell you why cuz God dislikes you because you're [ __ ] lazy start to work start to show God the beauty of his own Creations you'd be amazed how lucky you'll become lessons and Trauma and the more you go through the better of a man you are and if you were to find the best men on the planet I guarantee they've been through a bunch of terrible things the only way you learn lessons in life are the hard way or the harder way I try and say to overall that life as a man is pretty [ __ ] and you're going to feel [ __ ] for a pretty large percentage of the time but you're only going to ever escape that if you just perform regardless you have to perform when you feel bad as a man you can't say I will perform when I feel good it doesn't work that way CU our heads are too complicated and life's too complicated there's too much on our shoulders we have too much stress and too much pressure our heads are [ __ ] you have to be the kind of person who says I perform regardless I think follow your passion is also a ter terrible piece of ADV people say hey man you need to find your what Your passionate about and do that and what they're trying to say is only do what you like because you have no motivation to do anything else and motivation in and of itself is a scam I don't believe in motivation I believe in dis I am not motivated to do the things I'm supposed to do I don't wake up full of like Joy I have to go to the jam or that I have to work or I do crap I don't feel motivated to do them I'm disciplined I do them regardless of how I feel whether I'm in the mood to do it or I'm not in the mood to do it it gets done that's discipline discipline is a real thing motivation is fleeting you're never going to be permanently motivated so when someone comes along and says oh do what you're passionate about what they're saying is you'll have endless motivation and you be able to try hard you're the kind of person who can only try hard at something he enjoys then you're going to fail because most things you enjoy don't pay any money they paid money you wouldn't enjoy them it's called a job right nobody likes their job you like your hobby I'm sure you like playing video games maybe 1% .1% can make money from video games right most people you ain't ever going to make it do you think the guy in China who owns a concrete plant is passionate about it's money be passionate about success if you're passionate about money then you can be passionate about anything I'll be passionate about any business on Earth that pays me if you pay me a billion dollars to dig that hole I'll be very passionate about that hole I will dig that hole with passion all of your minds are broken you can't even focus on anything anymore right you are C distracted to the point where you can't even appreciate the good things in your life you're distracted your minds are broken you need to rewire your mind and resist the SL SL programming you must allow yourself to be manipulated and you must fix it all of it you just talked about not appreciating the things you have then blink and cure your brain it's not difficult there's just no competition because everybody's [ __ ] distracted they're getting distracted by this distracted by that watching [ __ ] Netflix jerking off to Pornhub like [ __ ] jackasses it's so easy to win if you can control your own mind the seems that nobody [ __ ] can and that's how the people who run the world keep the world running because they have all the slaves exactly where they need them to be permanently distracted and semi- depressed working their asses off in jobs which will never satisfy them and never pay enough money that's the Matrix I've never seen somebody eat right go to the gym every day train really hard and not I've literally never seen it the universe is extremely giving if you actually try and you actually want it and you're actually not making excuses lying talking [ __ ] you're going to get what you want i' I've always been a believer in the struggles men have in their minds and I've always spoke about it and I've suffered with them myself and this is one of the things when I say like depression isn't real people say oh you don't understand let me let me counter that argument by saying I understand very well me convincing myself and me deciding that depression isn't real is how I prevent myself from ever feeling depressed and I can I've only constructed that mental model because I've been in situations in my life where I felt depressed I'm not saying depression is isn't real because I've never felt depressed I'm saying depression isn't real because I've been very depressed the people don't understand where my mindset comes from I understand struggle and mental health and all these things and yeah jail was another chance to certainly touch on them because in jail you can in sorry in real life when you have my kind of resource you can distract yourself very easily if you're sitting around and feel a bit mopy if if I'm sitting here and I'm a bit like oh I can literally make a phone call and 45 minutes be in the air on my way to anywhere on the planet with whoever I want to do anything I want so you can distract yourself I'm not saying it fixes all mental health but it distracts you whereas in jail you are stuck alone with your thoughts and it was certainly a test of my mental resolve and I would say that I passed I I did well I I I there was never a day where I broke down there was never a day where I couldn't handle it there was never a day where I was you know I wasn't polite to the staff I was very nice to everybody there was never a day I couldn't hack it it was certainly a test and also you know Tristan said this I don't want to take his words but he's true you go through life telling everyone you're the baddest [ __ ] there is sooner or later something's going to test you you walk in the pub and you say I'm the hardest man there is sooner or later someone's going to fight you sooner or later and life's like that you want to be the top G and you want to go through life and say I'm the top G then God's going to say well we're going to see if you deserve to call yourself the top G or not we're going to put you in a Romanian jail cell we're going to leave you there it's a raw you're not going to know how long you're in there for and the biggest mind [ __ ] is I thought I was going to be in there for years I didn't I had no idea everyone's telling me years years years I thought I was going to be in there for years so maybe God was just seeing he was watching me and he was having a look and saying you want to call yourself top G let's see and I like to think I passed that test so it is what it is but yeah I agree with you in terms of mental struggles yeah they exist for all men and I also think that's one of the reasons I'm so large I talk about those things a lot I talk about those things a lot with men and I help men with them and I try and say to men overall that life as a man is pretty [ __ ] and you're going to feel [ __ ] for a pretty large percentage of the time but you're only going to ever escape that if you just perform regardless you have to perform when you feel bad as a man you can't say I will perform when I feel good it doesn't work that way cuz our heads are too complicated and life's too complicated there's too much on our shoulders and we have too much stress and too much pressure our heads are [ __ ] you have to be the kind of person who says I perform regardless I didn't miss a single day's training I didn't miss a please I didn't miss a thank you I'm not saying I was happy I'm saying I did exactly what I was supposed to do the worst thing about prison I think for everybody else because there was a lot of men in there who were crying a lot of men who were having mental breakdowns I think it is the problem I didn't have which is knowing that if you're a normal man you go to jail and they just pick you up and you go to jail who pays the rent who's feeding your kids who's your wife sleeping with like life gets hard for all the external things you can no longer control things that were your responsibility I was lucky I didn't have those problems and when I spoke to people most people's issues were things that were happening on the outside and I felt really good knowing that my life is set up in a way where even if I'm plucked from it it offerings and I set that up because I thought they were going to kill me even to this day if they shoot me right now everyone around everything would be okay I don't have to exist for my life to F so that was fantastic about jail the worst thing about jail I mean the Cockroaches started off really bad but after a few days it's amazing how quickly you get used to cockroaches just in your bed you just like kick them out the way that was kind of bad but um not knowing when I'm going to get out that was bad having my name slandered all around the world that was bad not knowing how people are reacting to it like my first time month in jail I didn't know if people believed this garbage or not I I had no access to the internet I didn't see anything there was a lot about it that was hard but uming the shadow I have to believe it's going to make me a better person why else would I why else did I go what did I go for to waste 3 months to stare at a wall for 3 months is that why I went to jail no I must have gone to jail to become a better person I must have learned something I have to self-analyze and find them lessons and pick it out and I think a lot of people don't do that with all the bad situations in their life regardless of when you went to jail or a woman left you or your business failed whatever it is you need to analyze the entire situation and say okay what can I learn there's a there's a big pile of [ __ ] here but there must be a little bit of gold inside so I've just tried to look at it as a massive learning experience and perhaps that's a coping mechanism but I found a lot of lessons which I'm implementing and uh and there's a very strong chance they're going to put me back not because I'm guilty because I haven't done anything wrong but because I'm currently in the middle of a a judicial system in I'm in the judicial system of a country I don't truly understand the language I don't understand the judicial system I don't understand the charges against me I don't understand any of this can be legal I don't understand how where it's come from I don't understand the evidence they believe they have and here I am stuck in this process and who knows how it's going to end mindset is your key to everything
