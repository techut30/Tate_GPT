Andrew it's been uh well nearly a year since we last sat down together very different time it was in my London studio and eight days after that you got arrested what's the year been like for you it's certainly been an interesting one I've been constrained this entire year I spent 93 days in a Romanian dungeon five months locked in my house and now I'm restrained within the country of Romania so it's certainly been a turbulent time the moment you got arrested it was all pretty dramatic the video came out the world saw it a lot of people smashing into your your home did you have any inkling warning that something like this may happen I knew it I kept saying before I was arrested on every single podcast I did I said you get three lives in the world the first life they're going to cancel you they're going to slander you they're going to delete your access to social media so you can't defend yourself the second life they're going to try and put you in jail for no reason and if you continue to speak against the power they're going to assassinate you I knew I was on my second life I kept saying it I knew it was coming I didn't know the reason they'd use but I found out once I was in a cell when you were arrested you you didn't actually you don't speak any Romanian at all Z and they didn't speak English to you correct so you were taken to a cell you had no idea what they were alleging you done I was arrested on the 27th of December so because of Christmas and New Year's and other problems they couldn't even translate my paperwork for two weeks so for the first two weeks I was in a prison I had no idea why I was given papers in Romanian I could read human trafficking I understood but I was like human trafficking who when what none of this makes sense I waited two entire weeks inside of my cell before I was given an English translation and then I realized exactly how ridiculous the whole case was just to clarify I accused of helping my friends get big on Tik Tok that is what I'm accused of I told some girls I know how to post on Tik Tok to become viral when I was at the time the most viral person on the planet and they are saying I'm a human trafficker for that that reason it is insane well we'll come to what you've been accused of it's more serious than the way you've categorized it but we'll come to that there is a lot of speculation that the reason the Romanian authorities knew that you were back because you were on Route I believe to Dubai for a New Year's Eve party is that you were interacting with Greta thumberg on social media and you had a pizza in front of you which came from a well-known Romanian Pizza uh store is there any truth to that I don't think so I think that they know where I was a lot of people knew where I was and uh they had instructions from higher up to teach me a lesson I was on my second life and that's exactly what I'm going through right now there's an irony to your situation because you always said the reason you came to Romania was precisely because you thought you could avoid being in this situation well I loved Romania and it's a strong Christian Nation with strong Traditional Values I want a life where I'm left alone by government I don't believe in big government I'm trying to avoid that if felt like Romania was a place which was very safe societally and the government was not too interested or involved in people's lives but things changed also your freedom and your ability to speak the truth is heavily correlated to your insignificance when you become large and people start listening to what you say you soon realize you no longer have freedom of speech and it doesn't matter where you are are on the planet if they decide you must be assassinated you will be assassinated you in jail what was that like Romanian jail is not English jail describe it what was the cell like I have to be careful what I say because I don't want to insult the Romanian justice system which I'm still beholden to however it's exactly as bad as people would expect it to be luckily it was in the winter so the Cockroaches were not too bad it was also during Ramadan so I didn't have to eat so much which was helpful because of the situation I think the most stressful thing about it is I had no idea how long I was going to be in there for I was dragged from my house I was given papers in Romanian I didn't know why I was there I found out why I was there and it was garbage I couldn't couldn't seem to get out I could have been held for years it's very stressful and uh the best thing you can do is turn to God and and train as hard as possible I did thousands of push-ups a day everying were you in solitary this in this period three months I no I wasn't in solitary the entire month the entire time sometime I was by myself sometimes I was with other guys and sometimes I was with my brother so when you were on your own were they keeping you in there for 24 hours a day were you allowed out no I wasn't allowed out there was no yard time it was 24 hours a day locked in a single room probably three or four steps large and you do nothing but stare at the wall and you think how many days did you do that for on your own 11 12 I mean that's a pretty Grim scenario for for anyone life's Grim for you always being Mr confident you've said interestingly that you wouldn't categorize what you were feeling as depression because you don't believe in the concept of depression you and I have argued about that before but it sounds to me from what I've seen you say when you've talked about this that that was pretty close to depression what you were feeling life's grim and if you want to be a superhero you have to understand in every single superhero movie he is losing for 80% of the movie he's going to suffer for the majority of the movie before he wins at the end I've always want an exceptional life Pierce and I'm not a coward and I knew that by telling the truth about certain issues I was going to pay the price for it so I won't say that I deserve to be in jail but I certainly put myself in there by telling the truth to the populist and telling the truth and living but when you're on your own in that cell what were you thinking it's a long time to self-reflect right it certainly is and I think my number one concern when I was in jail despite the fact that my situation was Dire were my concerns as a man and all the people I have to take care of and my children and my family and the people I pay for and all the people who work for me and truthfully I wasn't worried about myself I was worried about everybody else and I think that's the true masculine FL frame did you get emotional did you shed tears in yourself I'm an emotional man I think I think men are hyper emotional we just have to control it I was extremely busy inside of my jail cell I had lots of push-ups to do I was very concerned about the people on the outside I was trying my best to get out it's difficult for me to answer the question because it was a interesting frame of mind I knew that God was watching and I had to perform it's very difficult for me to go through life saying I'm the top G I'm this I'm that and speak about mental resilience and mental toughness and then the second I'm thrown inside of a solitary confinement cell cower out I'm not that person there's some other people who talk about mental toughness and want to give advice and when bad things happen to them they end up addicted to prescription drugs I'm not a coward and I'm not a liar no but but it would be perfectly natural to be emotional in that scenario and there's no shame in admitting that I was emotional I missed people I missed them and I knew they missed me so I felt a long I felt strong sense of missing but you cried there were tears that ran down my face but I did not cry I mean that's crying I would disagree because you you're worried about admitting that you think it sounds absolutely not that's a perfectly fine scenario to cry in but I think the act of crying is an act of desperation to sit and to cry is an act in and of itself to do push-ups thinking of your children with tears running down your face but you're concerned with finishing as many push-ups as possible within that day I do not consider that crying I consider that tears running down my face when you found out what they were alleging you done sexual assault exploitation and so on what did you feel about that what was your first reaction my first reaction was ah the standard Playbook the standard playbook for anybody who speaks up against Power is sexual exploitation isn't that the normal one they go to can't we name like 10 or 15 people right now they hit him with this exact same garbage name a full grown man who's 36 or 37 years old who's not had sexual relations with a woman at some point in past and the way the Matrix works is they lie by Omission right they just hit Russell Brand with it I think they hit p didy with it this morning Julian Assange just got hit with it he's still in a Cell but lots of people get hit with these allegations and it turns out to be true a lot of people get hit with them and they turn out to be false so but you're to trying to make out all the people you just named innocent you don't know that of course I don't know that but a lot of people get hit and it turns why would you why would you assume they're innocent well I'll tell you why because the way the Matrix operates is it choose something which is heinous if they accuse me of drug dealing nobody would care they choose something which is heinous so the process itself is a punishment so they damage your reputation throughout the process regardless of whether they're successful or not then what they do is they lie by Omission they throw you in a cell they contact everyone you've ever interacted with 2,000 people I know were called and they were looking for one person to say they're a victim by the way they fail they did not even find one but if they did they would then say Andrew Tate's victim he's a sexual assaulter and they would remove the testimony of the 1,999 people who said I'm a very nice man Lie by omission and then they put together this entire package used the mainstream media to convince the world that you deserve to be in jail and that is how the Matrix operates I mean to be clear I don't know if you're guilty or not I do sure you're po entitled to say that and you know right of course I know but I don't know and I will await any trial that comes uh to see what comes out in the trial and see what happens right so I'm not going to prejudge the trial I'm not going to judge you and say I think you're guilty I don't know right we are where we are you've been charged with serious crimes and it's likely you'll face a trial and we'll see how that all plays out obviously going back to jail how are you treated by other people everybody in jail was extremely apologetic to me all of the staff the police officers everyone who worked in the jail the person who serving me my meal everybody was very sorry for what happened to me they made it very clear they knew it was garbage and they were apologetic that was the only Vibe I could give you they were kind of like listen you got too big I'm sorry this is how things work and sorry here's your meal nobody had any real problem with me none of the prisoners had a problem with me did you get into any finds there was a a a couple scenarios where violence could have occurred but I think once people realized that violence vience is a certainty and that you do not operate under a fearful realm they often aren't so interested so people threatened you I wouldn't say they threatened me but they would have liked to have got the opportunity to threaten me and what happened and they realized that would have been a bad decision and all in all did you what did you say to them because you don't speak Romanian so I didn't you're right I actually used a quote from Street Fighter I said uh I quoted dson and I said they do not understand the secrets of yoga fire cuz I knew they had no idea what I was talking about it was near the washing machines and they looked at me like I was completely crazy and they walked away there's more than one person correct and they made they made it clear what that they wanted to I have to be careful what I say because I'm still beholden to the Romanian Judicial System yeah but that's that's just an incident in jail that's do with a system corre incident an incident report was written and it's better I don't mention it but there was a direct threat to I've had threats yeah and I have threats every single day of my life and I think jail is a hyper pressurized version of real realityy and you need to have an extremely strong mind so you don't attack yourself and an extremely strong body so others don't attack you and I understood that there was a threat of violence at all times and I just decided to go through life extremely respectfully but make it clear if that's a decision somebody else wants to make that I'm prepared to partake one of the things I would think about other than my family immediate family but one particular member of my family if I found myself in jail would be my mother and what she would be feeling and what she'd be thinking she's been incredibly supportive to me I know yours has to you did you think about your mother I was extremely concerned for her I was concerned because the media establishment were hounding her she was obviously very worried but she knew she raised strong Sons but we're her number one protectors and I was concerned for her I I wasn't concerned for myself in jail I didn't even suffer in jail as Mo as much as I did when I got out I didn't have nightmares in jail I had nightmares once I left jail I was in the middle of a battle I don't think you get PTSD while you're fighting you get it afterwards I was in the middle of a battle trying to make sure sure that everybody I love and care about is taken care of and trying to make sure that bills are paid please understand the day I was arrested which is a year ago every single bank account that I have was Frozen all of my assets were taken I haven't had a a dollar of money 10 cars taken I think 15 15 cars and some and how many properties 15 cars six properties 20 diamond watches gold bars Cash Land every single bank account millions and millions and millions was the total value of everything They seized 16 17 million pound yeah and they took all of it and I still don't have access to any of these things I mean as we're doing this interview you're expecting to hear sometime today as to whether you may get those possessions back is it is it all or nothing do you get it all back or nothing correct as we sit here the judges deciding whether I get all of my items returned or I get none of them returned and truthfully under the law I should have never had them taken in the first place so we're going to see what the judge decides and I have to put my faith within the Romanian judicial system I have no other a choice I'm not a coward I'm not going to run but let's not talk about the Romanian Judicial System let's talk about the Judicial Systems of the world I've recently seen some very scary decisions in America in England in these Western democratic nations you see people doing 20 years for attending peaceful protests so you start to sit and wonder when you're in these situations what is a trial what is a judge what is this these are just people in a room which peace which peaceful process you talking about there's been a few and I who who's got 20 years for attending a peaceful protest I I don't want to say names I saw it somewhere on Twitter somebody attended I think it was uh a protest a prot trump protest and they ended up getting 20 years well if you're talking about the January 6th riots they were riots where people died well this they're not peaceful protest well it's interesting because the world is actually very nuanced and what I tried that wasn't Nuance that was a a huge mob of people I to attacking the US Campa well what I try to do is I try to look at a a broad spectrum of of events and I try to put things into a nuanced View and I don't try and take a instant black or white point of view on things and the fact that BLM were rioting and destroying the entire nation for months and during that exact week and then some other people got together with a opposing political view and are facing serious prison time for doing less damage than BLM did I find that kind of scary because people did die well in a democratic Nation we should all be the same under the law B you just to be clear on January the 6th people died people died during BLM I mean there are certainly inconsistencies in the way groups of people have been policed I think that's the same that's the same whether you're talking about the BLM marches to the pro Palestinian marches and so on right there's a lot of inconsistency age in well there's a lot of inconsistency in global policing I think I think that's a perfectly valid thing to say but the idea that someone's got 20 years for being in a peaceful March is not true the ones who've got the lengthy prison sentences have been held account for serious crime I'm not even condoning January 6th I don't even know the ins and outs of January 6th I wasn't there I'm not saying it should have happened what I'm saying is exactly what you have said there seems to be some massive inconsistencies in global policing now so when you end up in a position where you're speaking against the system as I do and you understand that there are massive inconsistencies in policing globally you start to sit down and seriously wonder if you stand a fair chance of a fair trial in any country on earth I actually have to give a massive credit to the Romanian judicial system because a judge one day sat down and said why are these boys in jail and let us go I don't know if I would have had a fair shot like that in many other nations when you were released from after about 3 months what was that feeling like I my my brother and I were in the same cell at that time we were extremely happy I remember using the last of my mouthwash during the day I had some rituals to keep me sane and I'd enjoy one Swig of mouthwash a day it's amazing how bored you get when you're staring at cockroaches and even that sensation there literally cockroaches in yourself correct how many at any given time at night there was a lot of them like what dozens or yeah a few there was an infestation we did our best to kill as many as we could it kept us entertained but uh they're annoying to sleep with but mouthwash was something I enjoyed every day the sensation of mouthwash made me happy and I remember using all of my mouthwash and then instantly my brain started turning to all of the things I need to do I'm a man I have responsibilities for 93 days I wasn't working I started concerning myself with okay I'm about to get out of jail thank God I'm going to leave who do I need to take care of what's paid do I have any money left are bills due is Mom okay are my children okay and I just started thinking about work and as soon as I got out I didn't sleep for three days I how many children do you have I'm less confidential why because the I have enemies and unfortunately I do not want to give them any information but you have more than one I have more than one correct right so obviously you're caring for your children I understand that as a father right and obviously and you have a partner yes are you married no I think I asked you last time and you were a bit cryptic about it you're not married yet no you have a partner who's the mother of your children correct the same woman is mother of all your kids it's confidential it's a bit stupid to say confidential it it is confidential Pierce it's confidential I don't think you marry and have kids with is confidential sure it is for me really of course I am a basically number one Enemy of the State peers look what they've done to me what have they put me in jail for at the beginning of this garbage people were sitting there thinking maybe he's a human trafficker it's been a year who show me a picture show me a video who's even an victim there's nobody the whole thing is made up well we're going we're going to come to what they say you've done right going to come to that but I'm just curious you come out of prison you've got no ability to access any of your assets how have you been functioning financially since then I believe in prayer and I trust in God prayer doesn't pay the bills and I do my very best but prayer doesn't pay the bills unfortunately absolutely everything I own was seized by the Romanian state so I'm just going to have to survive and do my very best but how I'm doing my very best Pier have you got wealthy benefactors helping you I'm doing my very best I wish I had wealthy benefactors I wish I had people on my side you can't function on on no income at all seems you can how I'm doing my very best Pierce what does that mean it means I'm doing my very best absolutely everything I own is owned is taken by the Romanian State I don't have anything they don't have how do you pay for food just have to do my best what does that what does that mean it means that I believe in God and I pray going to pay your bills God has been paying my bills so far it seems It's amazing how far faith can take you it's often when you have absolutely nothing left people turn to Faith but you should turn to Faith first and you should believe in God when things are good and he will be there when times are initially you were put on this sort of rolling 30-day house arrest and they kept renewing that month by month by month and then in June uh you and your brother and two others were formerly charged with rape trafficking and forming an organized crime group to sexually exploit women and there were seven alleged victims named in the indictment you said at the time I look forward to being found innocent um you said earlier who are these women were there are seven named in the end diment yeah have you seen the videos of them on the Internet saying we're not victims they made us be victims we told them presumably be analyzed in a trial do you know when the trial may be I have no idea it's going to be you believe it will happen I'm not sure it could get to a point where a judge anytime before the trial decides this case is garbage and throws it away if you ask me what I believe happened it's very simple they threw me in a jail cell knowing they had no case knowing they had no victims but they thought they plaster me all over the MSM and they say that I'm a bad person and they call enough people they will find the case they want they couldn't find it you name the date charged me they had six months to charge me usually the Romanian State even the American Embassy confirms to me charges within 30 days with me they used all six months trying to build a case and find actual victims of an actual crime they couldn't they charged me on the very last possible day they could unless they'd have to drop the entire case and they charge me with garbage because they have nothing there are no victims I've done nothing wrong and they've tried very hard and let me say something very pertinent to the to the audience here it's very difficult when you're thrown inside of a jail cell you do not have access to social media you do not have access to money the the entire MSM establishment are calling you a bad person hotlines are set up saying if Andre Tate's ever heard hurt you call this hotline you're a rich person where people may want to get money from you and exploit you and extract resource from you and they're sitting here calling anyone you've ever known they called my Gardener's daughter who I've never even spoken to asking if I've ever done anything wrong to her or said anything wrong to her trying to find victims of a crime that don't exist it's actually a miracle from God that no one's come out trying to extract money from me whole thing is garbage they could do this to anybody peers they could do this to you they could put put you in a Cell put all over the media you're a sexual exploiter and for 3 months talk about how bad you are when you can't defend yourself and call everyone you've ever interacted with and if anybody you were ever rude to Once decides they want a Payday or some Fame they can use it against you it's insane the the ranian authorities prosecution files uh accuse you of using verbal and physical abuse to keep women in line taking uh 50% I believe the women's online income although I believe that figure could vary could be up to 80% is that right no the they accuse me of exploiting women who made who did Tick Tock the same women who say we were not exploited he just told us how to do Tik Tok also in the in prosecution file if you want to talk about it there's not a single bank transfer there's not a single piece of evidence for any money so I'm accused of making money from Tik Tok but they haven't found any money there's no money and the victims are saying I didn't exploit them to do Tik Tok the whole thing is a joke what is I think problematic for you is the War Room which was a group miscategorized and misunderstood called the War Room correct okay and it had a lot of people who were dubb the generals who ran the War Room cor for you and the War Room had five to 600 members you paid I think $6,000 plus dollars to be a member of this and when you saw the the logs of the web chats between people from the war room to each other a lot of it made disturbing reading were you disturbed by it when you read that firstly a lot of that is a lot of that's fake secondly you think they're literally those logs are fake absolutely secondly but the BBC verified them the BBC verified them are they the same people who verified the vaccine those people they're Liars firstly a lot of them are fake secondly the war were you disturbed by anything you read no because none of it's real firstly secondly there's 4,000 members in the War Room thirdly the war room is about masculine personal development we talk about Fitness making money strength we talk about very important things I there's 4,000 members inside if you're telling me that amongst 4,000 members with 24-hour chat seven days a week for the Last 5 Years theyve managed to find two guys talking locker room talk and that somehow offends the world that nobody understands how the world works that's not why I was in jail it's nothing to do with the war room I was in jail because I spoke against Power because I told the truth about covid because I told the truth about the war in Ukraine because I told the truth about all of these things I don't understand why people would want to put you in jail with for giving your opinions about covid or Ukraine why would they why wouldn't they why would they why would they say why would they say that Andrew Tate's opinion is so important on Ukraine that we have to put him in jail I don't I don't buy that okay because I was the most Googled man on the planet and I had a huge Affinity with the most Troublesome demographic for the Matrix which is the young masculine youth the people who you need to die in Wars to people who you need to S off into being slaves to build the roads while telling them that they're not allowed a point of view and they're not allowed an opinion on anything and I was saying things which was going against the narrative and the Matrix the way I oper is it uses the MSM to purport lies to inject slave programming into people's brains so that we live lives which are not good for us but are good for them and I was sitting there unplugging it why would they sit there and say we've put together this massive sigh off we're going to convince everybody to inject themselves with poison and we're going to look everyone in their houses and it's all a lie and we're going to let this one gue everyone listens Andrew Andrew it wasn't all a lie yes it was it wasn't there was a new there was a new novel Corona virus okay I'll tell you what I'll tell you I'll tell you what I'll tell you what the facts were and you can then laugh at them if you wish but there was a novel Corona virus covid-19 it was killing thousands of people a day really yes absolutely yeah and as and I know people who died who doesn't I know people who died before Corona of f I'm sure people died lots of things but it was killing exponentially thousands and thousands of people and then vaccines were developed at very high speed and they managed to save in my estimation millions of Lies you may not agree with that but those are facts as assumed by the body of scientific and medical experts in the world the body of scientific and medical experts you mean the Matrix I could get what is the Matrix The Matrix are a bunch of people who can come up with studies from the sky to say anything they want them to say so they can use the MSM to report garbage inside of people's minds so you end up locked in your house clapping for the NHS like a performing seal injecting yourself with experimental poison for the ninth time it's a lie there was no reason to lock everyone in their house more people died from missed cancer appointments than anyone ever died of covid people always got the sniffles before Co they ' always got it since let me ask you a question where has Co gone diseases don't go away where's Co gone it wasn't well the co strains have got milder as indeed flu did flu used to kill gone away well flu pandemic in about a 100 years ago killed 50 to 100 million people and it's got steadily milder over the decade since this is normal medical science uh pathway for most pandemics right so on that I mean your sort of car IR it was all Matrix MSM nonsense is palpably untrue well I'll tell you why that's not untrue let me tell you my personal experience with Co I'm an extremely logical person at the beginning when everyone was dying dropping dead in the streets in China which I never saw by the way funny and the Italian hospitals were full English hospitals Were Never full funny me and my brother sat there and said if this disease is so deadly and can damage us as strong military age males and the world is over so there's no point in hiding in our house we decided to go to Sweden on day one of Co day one when everyone still believed we went to Sweden why does no one talk about the fact that Sweden was open the entire time time why does no one talk about the fact they didn't have masks or lockdown or vaccines my brother and I partied in nightclubs s days a week for three entire months while everyone in England walk had Sweden actually had a number of restrictions not when I was there open not as Draconian as we had in the UK and there were certainly legitimate questions to ask about the scale of our lockdowns I think people panicked they saw what was happening in in Italy which had the second best Medical Health Care system in the world and people were dying in massive numbers and the hospitals were overrun so people panicked did you hear about the guy who died in a motorcycle crash and it was a covid death did you hear about that one well there was certain Downing Street didn't seem very concerned with there was a long debate about people dying of covid or with covid I know all that but the bottom line for me it is indisputable that covid was a deadly pandemic that killed a lot of people it turned out a lot of older people more than young people but they didn't know that at the time not for a long period the vaccine saved millions of people's lives there are legitimate questions about some of the boosters about some of the side effects of the vaccines as there are by the way with all vaccines but the idea that Co is some invention by The Matrix to suppress and control its people is for the birds Andrew it's for the birds it seems the birds and I friend don't think a smart guy like you actually believes that of that's one of my problem one of my problems I have with you is that I think you are intelligent but I think you also adopt positions that you know are going to get the ant you know the anti-matrix mob inflamed and it's just these all-encompassing views you have covid was a load of nonsense vaccines are all dangerous and killing more people than they say said that I said the covid vaccine well covid vaccine well you don't think they worked no of course not because the idea of the the the word vaccine in and of itself is that you get they save millions of lives if you get a vaccine you do not get the disease they changed the definition of vaccine in the dictionary so they can continue to inject us with this pointless poison I had the vaccine for polio I've never had Polio you got the vaccine for covid and you're bragging online how you have Co for the eighth time but it's not that bad because you've had six injections it's insane and please understand my position please understand that I'm a person who doesn't believe any of these studies don't believe any of this garbage Don't Believe The Matrix I'm a person who was in Sweden for three months as everyone was afraid locked in their houses partying at will and it was perfectly fine they had a lower death rate than the UK they had a much higher death rate than their neighboring countries in Scandinavia did you know that they had a lower death rate the UK did you know that it doesn't no I didn't know that doesn't matter to you of course not so you wouldn't compare them to their immediate neighbors you'd only compare them to a country in the UK If you think lockdowns worked Pierce if you think lockdowns I think lockdowns were only acceptable as an immediate uh Panic move which it was before there were vaccines the moment they had a successful vaccine program that worked then there was no justification for further lockdown you're a very important person and you're very well respected I'm not important I'm a journalist no you're very important and you're very well respected within the UK and you've been famous for a very long time were you invited to the party at Downing Street or were you not in that S no no that's a shame and I thought the behav they seemed very concerned about Co on the TV and they didn't seem to give a  soon the TV was on I thought that was disgraceful and I thought Boris Johnson and the people working at number 10 who were having those parties uh when I had friends of mine who were literally saying goodbye to their mothers on FaceTime on their phone because they weren't allowed in to see them and you people in Care Homes where it ripped through and killed a third of the people in the home in two weeks and the desperation that people felt at a cousin lost his father who couldn't go and see uh his dying wife and so on there were disgusting there were terrible stories criminal terrible stories it's disgusting so let me ask you a question as a professional because we're both adults we're both very smart as a professional which is more likely that the government believed covid was deadly and everybody should be truthfully afraid and locked in their houses but because they had this spirit inside of them and they couldn't resist the idea of a party decided to risk their lives to party or they lied on the television trying to scare everyone and enslave them and lock them in their houses knowing it's garbage knowing it's a lie and not caring and had a party behind everyone's back so they didn't think they get caught which one is more likely as a professional as a logical human why don't we just agree that they were a bunch of rank Hypocrites stupid people who were behaving utterly selfishly to the extent that the queen when her husband Prince philli dies is in the church on her own in a mass with none of her family around her after losing a rock of 70 years and it turned out the night before down the street had had I think two parties including a karaoke party I think that was shameful and disgraceful well I we can agree on that we can agree on that and we can wake up and start to realize oh maybe the government doesn't care about us maybe the government lies to us maybe they tell us things and try and scare us but they don't actually care themselves maybe all they are is hypocritical self-interested people maybe they are maybe then and maybe they use the MSM to purport their lives to keep everybody enslaved well they do whatever they want and that is the Matrix and and of itself and if you speak against it and people listen to you I'll repeat this your ability to speak freely is directly correl Rel to your insignificance if you're as big as I was the most Googled man on the planet telling the truth you will pay the price Pierce and that is why I was locked in that cell and I do not regret it because I live true to God I'm not going to sit here as a coward and not tell the truth to people for as long as I live until they put a bullet in my head let me ask you about the lover boy method so the suggestion is that you and your brother and others uh but you let's talk about you that you deployed the lover boy method where you would make women fall in love with you you would then persuade them to do webam webcam stuff right Tik Tok okay but wait it's called it webcam stuff right no it's not called it that the indictment is about Tik Tok okay what would you make the women do or what would they do with you I don't make anybody do anything in fact let's talk about the lover boy method so it's very interesting let's Imagine The Matrix is pissed off with a set individual who's telling too much truth and everybody is listening to him and they decide they're going to attack him with sexual assault claims they say ah he's making women do well we found conversations where he gave advice on how to go viral on Tik Tok he's making women do Tik Tok but he isn't being horrible to them he's not hitting them he's not being mean to them so what can we do let's use the lover boy method if I was abusive and mean they wouldn't say lover boy method you know lover boy method means being nice he was nice and polite and kind and they really liked him as a person and he told them how to do Tik Tok a l boy of course it is Andrew that's not what the lover boy method is absolutely it is the lover boy method is where perpetrators woo victims with the prospect of a loving relationship until they can be forced into abusive situations or a form of slavery this is garbage that's actually it means the lover boy method is being nice to people so that you work together effectively what they're trying to say here I was nice to girls who asked me for Tik Tok advice and they sang It's The Lover Boy method I didn't beat them into doing Tik Tok I didn't force them I didn't threaten them in fact I was like yeah you're very pretty you can be pretty famous element of coercion How can there be an ele what does that even mean let's be professionals here what does that even mean what do you think coercion means I was coerced into this interview you came along to me and said you weren't coerced into this inter yes I was well don't tell me the bullying MSM and said Andrew you've got to do an interview and I'm going to fly all the way toia to do it me that you used the lover boy method you said sir the lover boy meod yep Andrew this is going to be a very interesting interview we had a good one last time you're a nice guy we have some interesting conversations I'm going to come along minute wa a minute we're going to make some money from this interview money will be made for both sides you L boyed me you stole the profit minute just to be clear I've had no conversation with you about this interview and the conversations I've had with your intermediary were very professional and I said I would like to do an interview were you nice of I'm always nice lover boy you can't believe you use niceness to lover boy me because this is a profitable Enterprise and I was cered here I make no pretense that I'm into I've come all the way from London to rainia to interview you because yes I want to do it on my show and that will clearly benefit me and my show am I a full grown consenting adult who decided to the idea but you're not being coerced into do am I a full- grown consenting adult who decided to do this show yes okay so I wasn't coerced correct what that got to do with what I've asked you because you were nice to me and you're saying that I wasn't nice to you I didn't even talk to you being nice is the lover boy method and that adults have no responsibility and nice to someone they they become your slave I wasn't nice to you and I didn't call you a nice guy I feel lover boy H I feel lover boy I'm sorry well I'm sorry it's fine it's you had a a website Hustler's University offering courses teaching husbands and boyfriends how to get their Partners absolutely false the husters university which you can go to now actually change the domain it's university.com is a school which teaches modern wealth creation methods we teach people how to make websites we teach people Ecom why did you call it why did you call it a PhD pimping hose degree no you're talking about an old video which was made satirically why did you call it that oh that's Sati of course it was nine years ago the internet was a very different place and if you're going to sit here and say oh nine years ago you said stupid things on the Internet it's not a gotcha moment because every single person has so Of You' so of you cuz you advocated for the vaccine sir so you said stupid things on the internet like that's how things go it's satirical I also said I'm an astronaut do you believe I've been to the Moon because I haven't Believe It or Not hust University teaches children how to make websites and it teach and it's there only one reason I'm ask only reason I'm ask you you've repeatedly said in interviews since you were arrested that you have never categorize yourself as a pimp you don't think you're a pimp right well what about all the rappers did you ask Ice Cube if he's a pimp and a murderer and a drug dealer JZ sold crack I'm not inter I'm not interviewing them I'm asking you whether you have at any stage in the last 15 years being a pimp of course I've not been a pimp I've said I'm a pimp I've said I'm an astronaut I've said I'm a cowboy I've said I'm the strongest man in the world I've said I'm James Bond throw me in jail are you just put me in jail I deserve it nine years ago I made a joke on the internet so here's my question are you are you a fantasist I'm not a fantasist do you have a Persona that's just not you of course not I am me well if you are you why would you repeatedly call yourself a pimp and then now say you never been a pimp are you going to sit here and say that because I've once said oh I'm curious ious whether if you you're trying to say to me you didn't mean any of the things you said so I'm asking myself well why should I believe anything you say now in other words is what you say actually what you mean is Andrew Tate real or do you have a complete Persona that you fueled for money that has nothing to do with the real you I don't know you tell me I exaggerated on the internet N9 years ago for comedic effect I'd walk into a nightclub and there'd be girls at my table like every other man who walks into a nightclub and I'd say Pimpin oh no put me in jail 93 days was not enough with the Cockroaches I should go back this is a matrix attack Pierce every single person every single man out there has done things worse than I've done in fact I will argue if you put 99.9% of men through the level of scrutiny I've been through by F by multiple federal agencies you will find a lot worse than him saying he was a pimp on the internet nine years ago you will find actual genuine crime and I've done nothing I live true to God this is all garbage and it's not real like I said to you I I don't know if you're guilty or not I do and I am not guilty Matrix attack I want to be clear to you I'm not preempting your guilt I've come here with a completely open mind you've been charged with serious offenses but I am not going to judge you because I'm not a judge and this is not courtroom right but it's interesting to me that one of the biggest charges against you is that you're a misogynist and you've always said I'm not a misogynist and the last time I interviewed you you said well I may have said some things that you know may have been misconstrued but even in the last week you've tweeted some stuff which I'm not even sure if you're aware as you tweet this stuff how it sounds read it okay let's read this is quite a long one sure but I think it's important to read it to get a sense of how you view women absolutely any woman I date does not have a job um okay so the woman you're with doesn't have a job no okay do you date other women sometimes and your partner's fine with that obviously yeah and you you're fine with that why wouldn't I be well you think it's fine to be dating other women when you're when you you have a mother I think we're consenting adults and everybody can make their own personal decisions fair enough why would why I be working so hard you say to have hundreds of millions of my woman to waste her life enslaved pennies no I will give you a life you can never ever afford private jets festar hotels new cars endless spending money and diamonds you'll be rich because you're praying for me every day and protecting my spirit I work in the physical world she works in the spirit realm would women shouldn't have to work because being a good partner is a full-time job for a woman she has to look good all the beauty treatments a Time intensive not about money takes a lot of time you just to train every day and stay in fantastic shape Shops look amazing next to me I know there are some men who do a hundred times more than this on a daily basis but women are not as organized as men and achieving anything significant causes them huge amounts of stress yeah they need to have huge sections of their day empty to waste or they will have a mental breakdown true and do you want a woman who's stressed and angry after the commute unshaven and exhausted or do you want a Barbie doll who's always smiling and saying thank you because she did her nails and brought you proud of that day as a man unless you're a loser you're already Filthy Rich right you can get endless sex anyway Girls Are Easy so what can a girl give you happiness Vibes always smiling take the edge of a stressful life can she always be happy if she's been working all day no just to wake up at 11:00 gym till 1 one appointment and some shopping dress Beautiful by 7:00 p.m. for you to finish working and tell you how strong you are no matter how pissed off you are just to always be laughing and smiling and writing your little notes about how you're perfect and just to be playful and funny she can't do that if she has a job so your job is being my girlfriend and now you're a milli iire congratulations behave and aim for the promotion to wife the reason I read all that in detail was I don't think you understand quite how that comes over because I think that is the purest definition of misogyny I probably ever read well I don't think you understand one especially when I'm talking about the fact that women can't handle what men can do Etc one it's slightly sarcastic there's a sarcastic to do you mean any of this I mean all of it any woman I'm with I will provide for because no woman should work they should spend all day def find themselves for you right and they might get promoted to wife your job is being my girlfriend there are there are hundreds of millions of women around the world who do a good day's work who still manage to be a very good wife or partner agree completely but it's my why would you encourage why would you encourage a whole generation of young men I mean I've got to be honest since our last two interviews before you arrested I would say every single day I have young men teenage boys Maybe early 20s coming up to me asking about you it's gone on every day since I interviewed you I'm very aware of your reach I'm very aware of your influence and I've I've whenever I've been asked about you say what do you think of him I said I don't really know I find myself agreeing with 60 to 70% of the things you say and I do because I think a lot of the stuff you say about empowering young men to be confident to work out to take care of themselves to have enough money to not all not force their woman to work right that's the bit that's the bit where when you stray into that kind of language particularly in the detail where you reveal what you're really thinking a the kind of pathetic soulless life you want for these women where does it allow for being a mother for example being absolutely that's how does a mother of your children manage to find time for being a mother how does in this routine of love and Devotion to you does how does having a job give her time to be a mother this gives her all the time in the world to be a mother one it slightly sarcastic firstly what you mean you tell by the tone do you mean you don't mean it no I mean it which but it's slightly sarcastic sarc comic effect sarcasm means you don't mean it no I mean it but it's slightly SAR you mean it or you don't it's either sarcastic or it's not I mean every single word this is the conundrum with you sarcastic this is the conundrum with you right it's not a conundrum if you'd let me explain it's not a conundrum at all also very interesting I tweet this out I get thousands of women begging me inboxing me saying finally a man who understands he needs to provide for a woman so she can be her best self this is exactly the kind of life that will allow there are definitely women wom that will absolutely love to be so why don't you treated like misogynists uh no but what I think they are they're people who just basically it's the old sugar daddy thing right they want to have a rich guy who's going to pamper them and take care of them they don't have to do a day's work they just have to make being a good partner is work well so you say yeah but it also the language that you use here seriously diminishes women who do work you make them out to be well you're not doing your job as a partner or wife you should be doing your job which is just to devote yourself to his pleasure and making him well it's actually interesting you say that because I'll put a lot of the fault of this on men let's let's if you want to gender the argument let's do that I think that a lot of the reason why women can't live this life if they so choose if you're a woman who decides to work then go to work I don't care but if you're a woman who decides she wants to retire it's because she can't find a man who could provide for her at this level do you think when a woman marries a billionaire that she wants to go get a job in Starbucks cuz in my experience when they marry extremely successful men they don't want a job I'm sure Ronaldo's wife isn't begging to go work in Ikea actually's wife works very hard she works for herself which is different and her family of course yeah which is different she's a hardworking woman absolutely because being a fantastic partner and having a bunch of children is a bunch of hard work and she also finds the energy to have us businesses on the side fantastic what we're saying here but you don't want women to have businesses no I'm saying if you're with a man of my stature you don't have to work now if I met a perfect woman and we were together and we were happy when you say a man of your statute with respect right now you have no income no possessions correct facing you're facing serious criminal charges I mean I'm not quite sure what statue you think you're currently selling but it ain't great okay well then it's it's shame all those women inboxed me after I put that tweet out saying we agree with you I think you should interview I met a woman yesterday who when I said I was coming to interview was immedi like or can you put a good word in for me of course sure you have a you have a definite appeal to a certain type of woman there's no question question providing for woman financially is a man's responsibility if that means I'm a misogynist then I'm a misogynist I think so you accept you accept you are a mass no I think a man should provide for a woman financially completely and utterly if she wants to work if my partner were to say to me right now I really feel like getting a job it would make me happy then I'll say work but she doesn't have to her job is looking after the children looking after me and being as happy as possible if you think I'm a bad person for saying if you actually read that read the subtext and context okay good then you will understand what I'm saying you know I did you heard it absolutely so what I am saying is I am a man my life is stressful my life is pain I go to jail I suffer I have to deal with making money I have constant endless headache I do all of that so I can give you everything but then I get to have you your job is to be happy I want you to smile I want you to look your best and feel your best all of the time if I'm I a misogynist for saying that I go through so much pain so that we can be financially secure so I hope the woman I care about does not have to work a job if that makes me a bad person then so be it because all I'm saying is I want to take care of her in every single realm I take care of her physical safety I take care of her Financial Security that is is my job as a man and if more men acted like me you will see that the world would be a happier and better place the women who say I really want to work I want a career that's their prerogative and their decision they're allowed to do that but also often the reason they do that is because they can't find a man they trust to take care of them I've had this I've had this from women in their own mouth if I found a man who was financially secure and as smart as you I wouldn't be doing this garbage job either why was I scoped into working to pay taxes when I should be at home having children with a man door a Andrew there are so many women that will listen to that and be laughing and mocking you will say don't be so ridiculous I have a job that I love maybe they're being paid even more than their man right the real world isn't the one that you categorize the real world is varied and nuanced but I am talking about my life experience my experience any woman I love does not have to work unless she decides you're the boss you're in charge her job is to make you happy her job is to make herself look good her job is to work out for your benefit blah blah blah blah blah it is actually just misogyny do you think a woman looking do you think a woman looking good and working out is has no benefit at all to her of course it does okay so it's not for my benefit then is it see but when but when you talk about when you talk about no no I don't when you talk about young men and you tell them to work out and take care of themselves I cheer you on right I want that I've got three sons I want them to feel that don't you want them to become very rich and successful and have a woman who relies on them and have a beautiful family no but I don't want a woman who observ to them why is subservience why is a woman literally the tone of the tweet I read is subservient you did another tweet this week men Love by telling you what to do and not allowing you to make stupid decisions we save you from the female inclination to make stupid choices if a man isn't giv you instructions he doesn't love you if you won't listen to a man's instructions you don't love him the whole language is so ridiculous let me change the language then well you tweeted this to 8 8.2 million people correct so let me say this a father loves let's say instead of a man loves say a father loves a father loves disciplinarian that's how a father will love you a mother will say oh I hope you're happy hope you're doing okay but but a father will come along and say no don't do this you must do it that way that's incorrect it has to be this way a father will discipline you because a father feels he knows best for you it's the masculine essence of Love When a Man Loves he shows that he cares by a degree there is a massive difference between a relationship between a father and a child and between a man and a woman in a relationship and I'm not sure you quite get no there is a difference but I would argue Pierce I would argue in the happiest relationships it's a traditionally masculine role in which the man plays and provides the female is traditionally feminine the man is the head of the house not in abusive way doesn't beat her up I'm talking about the man being the head of the household like I would like to believe you're the head of your household and he comes along and says what happens and what doesn't happen because he's the man of the house no that's not that's actually not how most households operate well then it sounds like we understand why the entire world's a mess because only 10 years ago that's exactly how the households operated there was a man of the house and now we have no longer any clear defined roles there's no more longer a man of the house you want to talk about knife crime kids doing drugs the crime rate all of these problems we talking about all of the societal ills we Face perhaps it's because we don't have any men in the house anymore perhaps we need to bring the man of the house back and the man of the house will come along and be a disciplinarian and he will make the set rules and the Creeds of that house he will say within in this household we don't take drugs that stands for the woman I am with the children who we have birthed nobody takes drugs in this household because this is my house and I'm the man of the house so it sounds to me like we need to bring it back sir yeah listen it's all good Macho stuff okay and I know lots of young boys who listen to this and go wow that's how I should be then I read the detail of your tweets and again come back to this we save women from their female inclination to make stupid choices females are emotional if a man isn't giving you instructions females are emal hang all this stuff is designed to exactly as you've just articulated is designed to make young men feel that the only way they can be successful in life is to effectively have their women under control give them instructions buying them they have to obey don't Don't Buy Women you'll end up in jail you can buy them Prada but let me let me finish my point my point is that it seems to me from reading your tweets even now that you have a blind spot when it comes to how they sound and it may and it may be that the legal problems that you're in which might be extremely serious and we'll see when the trial happens but it may be that in your head nothing you've done is remotely inappropriate because actually in your tweets you can see there's an element there of wanting coercion and control you want to control women you want them to be effectively your servants slaves for want of a better place slav slaves who get Prada and get to work out in the gym and get to look good while I do but you understand the point I'm making no I don't because which is in your head the line is blurred so much now with this Macho rhetoric that you've actually lost track of how this sounds here's all of the things I even when I read that stuff to you I could see you looking at me and you you're answer is I was being sarcastic and I said well where then you go well no I meant it well you can't be both I meant it and I said tone you either mean it or it's well no because sarcasm means you don't mean it Pierce all the things you've just do you accept that no I SM guy you know what sarcasm means absolutely I said it has a sarcastic tone for comedic effect all the things I'm saying and the things I've said are basically the way the entire world fought only 10 years ago you may buy into the scop you may buy into the new thing I don't buy into any scops uh we just talked about the vaccine sir yeah the vaccines weren't Sops of course not so I believe that there should be a man of the house you had a polio vaccine right correct why because I didn't get polio I wouldn't have a covid vaccine because I'd still get covid plus probably myartis and have a heart attack so we believe there was a man of the house years ago do you think statistically more people got myocarditis by having the vaccine or not having it I think statistically we need to bring you don't know do you why would I know why would I look at the statistics studies that come from The Matrix itself so the Matrix so every fact you don't like because it doesn't suit your agenda you just dismisses Matrix no I'll give you a very simple way I view the world Co can't hurt me so why would I take their injection point they tried to make us including you you told people they should have the vaccine if they don't have it they shouldn't leave their house you know why because at the time the scientists and by the way scientist is ever evolving at the time I said that the scientist said if you had the vaccine it would prevent you transmitting the virus matx that turned out to be wrong and they issued updated advice saying further studies said that actually you could transmit it and at that point you know what I did which you never do I held my hands up I went I was wrong because the advice changed and now I would not say the same thing that is called actually evolving opinions when facts change that's actually how a civilized democracy works oh is it we live in a civilized democracy do we sir I actually would argue that point with you for very for a very long time I don't think we live in a civilized democracy another point I want to make here if I had cancer or if I was a threat of a genuine disease which could actually harm me would the NHS text me 10 times a day trying to get me treatment or would I be sitting there waiting for month get an appointment they wouldn't care about me they let me die so the fact that they will endlessly text me and try and beg me to get this poison should been an alarm Bell for anybody with a brain actually they I tell you what the an sent me I'm a 58y old man in the last few months they've sent me uh one about a flu jab which I'm going to have um because I think it stops you getting flu and flu is nasty uh a covid booster which I won't have I think I've had enough of those I'm fine with that thanks uh they sent me one about having a check for a bow cancer which I've done and came back negative and so on and so on the NHS texting system is for our benefit you don't have to do it no one's holding a gun to your head The Matrix isn't saying if you don't have this Andrew Tate we're going to we're going to do something to do you have any idea not you've not being treated in Romania by their system because of anything to do with covid vaccines and your attempt to try and persuade people that that's the case is ridiculous and you know it's ridiculous do you have any idea how difficult it was to remain unvaccinated peers let me tell you from somebody who was unvaccinated and traveled the world do you have any idea how difficult that was actually because countries had border controls oh because they tried to force everybody so to sit and say they weren't trying to force you know what they did they said come get the covid vaccine it's good for you it's going to help they tried to coarse you by being nice they tried to lover boy everybody they tried to use the lover boy method to force people to get the covid vaccine it just came to we need to put all these people in jail they were being nice to people trying to help them unbelievable nobody forced you to have it did you have the vaccine absolutely and utterly not sir my principles are not for sale I would have stayed in my house to the end of human time and sat there as a pure blood the last one the last pure blood on the planet before I inject myself with poison you're not making an MGM trailer yes I am because it's a matter of principle I am not a farm animal my blood is mine it does not belong to the government and I decide what is in it right all right so you have a polio vaccine but not one so your brilliant brain is deter that you know more about the medicinal and scientific benefits of individual vaccines and the PO one you decided with your brilliant brain will have that but even though a lot of people by the way have had side effects to polio vaccines did you know that yes correct is that the Matrix doing that no I didn't say the Matrix gave him the side effect I've just told you all the reasons I didn't get the vaccine already described it at length but you work out with your brilliant mind which vaccines to have correct okay correct you realize you can join my email list on corporate.com you can sign up for free and I'll tell you which vaccine I wouldn't come to you for vaccine advice Andrew because you have zero experience I didn't get didn't get the I did I obviously did pretty good I avoided the poison shot while everyone else got it so I'm actually pretty proud with my track record what happens if you're found guilty of the things you're charged with well then I'm going to have to go to jail I assume what's the maximum sentence you could get I don't know I don't you do I I actually genuinely don't you've never asked your lawyers I it can be between three to eight years I think so you do know I don't know the maximum but if you were to serve eight years having to serve three months and know how bad that was could you cope with that in a Romanian jail interesting question could I cope with it yes would I be the same afterwards I'm not sure what do you think even the three months did to you as a man well it was a fantastic test from God to make sure I am the man I say I am because I think there's a lot of people who speak about masculine Excellence who are not the men they say they are when trouble appears you often learn that they are nothing but postures I had nightmares for a very long time I couldn't sleep I I struggled with certain things I would check my bed sheets every single night for cockroaches religiously I had a problem with that but I never turned to therapy I never turned to drugs I understood that all of these things are from God and they're given to me so that I can become a stronger version of myself and I welcomed them all and I embraced them all and now that I'm a better not completely but almost better part of me actually misses my nightmares Pierce part of me misses training all night I didn't sleep for weeks months you you said you didn't have nightmares no I had nightmares I said I didn't have nightmares in jail when I left I did and I kind of miss it because I had so much time in the day to get things done and now I'm sleeping a full six hours I feel a little bit lazy so perhaps I need another test from God and if God decides Allah is the best of planners if he decides I need eight years in jail then I will Embrace those eight years in jail and do my absolute best to come out as the most formidable version of myself have you felt suicidal at all in the last year I don't believe in suicide is Haram I know you've said that before but did you feel like you may want to end it all I would never kill myself under any circumstances so the day they put that on the news when they finally take me out you can know it's a lie it's Haram I would never kill myself lock me in that cell for the rest of my life I would never kill myself while you under house arrest you you tweeted this avoid women who go to festivals they're either on some losers table who's feeding them cocaine or in a crowd of sweaty peasants because they're a sweaty peasant endless Instagram stories screaming and having fun to prove to the world they're worthless hard past festy H correct I tweeted that yes again why would you categorize all women who go to festivals in such an unpleasant way I actually categorized all men who went to festivals also did you read that tweet why are you gendering the argument I think all people who go to festivals are stupid it is peasantry I've never been to a festival in my life I'm not going to stand there and scream and jump up and down for some other human like he's God I think the whole thing is embarrassing all of it from head to toe it's all sweaty peasantry and it's all just drug fueled Insanity so why are you gendering the argument when I insult the women who go to festivals and also the men who go to festivals because all of it is peasantry head to toe and I do not regret it all Festival or peasantry anybody who goes I do not associate with I've never been to one in my life I never will so you've never been to one how do you know what they're like I can see enough I've seen the sweaty bodies bumping into each other high on ketaman pretending that the song they heard on the radio at home is now more fantastic because they're listening to it from a loudspeaker embarrassing to be clear you'd never been to one correct okay my infinite brain that understands vacc perfectly we have established your brain is unique correct uh you you tweeted a picture of Amanda Holden very good friend of mine uh it's a very harmless picture she's in a bikini on holiday under a rain shower uh looking extraordinarily uh beautiful in a sexual pose and you tweeted you are a wife and a mother and you're far past a teenager there's no need for this post agreed again it's just misogynist to say that it's not misogynist kind a woman of her race she's just turned 50 why can't a woman of that age actually show off her beautiful body in a in a nice bikini like that what's wrong with that you can call me crazy you can call me misogynistic but I think once you reach the ripe age of 50 any woman should not be interested in thirst trapping on Instagram I think she has bigger responsibilities I'm sure she's a very intelligent lady and she's done amazing things she's famous she's obviously very capable and I think she could do things more interesting than standing around trying to thirst trap on Instagram like she's 18 I think she's above it I wasn't insulting her I was reminding her that she's actually such a fantastic person she's done such amazing things in her life and she's so achieved that she's actually above thirst trapping I was reminding of her of her worth because as a feminist we're all feminists here right we all believe in women empowerment I'm reminding of her her of her worth are you a feminist sure you're not though are you I believe in feminine empowerment and I think feminine empowerment is in yes I do and feminine empowerment is in modesty modesty is empowering for Fe for females believe taking your clothes off from Men on Instagram is not empowering it's empowering when you say no man but my husband can see my body that is female empowerment and I was reminding her of that I was reminding her of her ripe age and her intellect and there is no need for that how old are you now I am 36 36 years old at what point will your antics you know chugging your cigars in your ripped body in your compound with your security and your Bugattis at what age does that become a thirst trap I don't know if that ever stops being a thirst trap because so it's fine for you once again one rule for the man another rule for the woman it's interesting because I've never heard this argument before but I'm extremely intelligent I've already deciphered how this is going to go from head to toe it's called I guess we can look at peacocks right the male peacock he shows look who I am looks look what I can do look at my achievement look at my beautiful feathers and I guess you could call it peacocking to a degree I'm showing the world I'm extrem I'm extremely physical cap I'm extremely physically capable yes that's correct I'm extremely financially successful you stripping off for Instagram is fine it's not stripping off for Instagram I'm boxing when you box you Bo no top on you do it all the time with your cigar and you're showing off your Rip but that's fine for you but if a man to Holden dares do it that is apparently thirst trapping I think me boxing with no shirt on is different than a 50-year-old woman post you just box I've seen you doing ones where you wander around all Moody with your cigar and your topless and stuff so fine for you are you a fan Pierce uh no I just think it's first trap do you yeah well I don't do that perhaps it's successful maybe you should start perhaps it's successful because I do have a lot of female fans out there in the world and they pretend I'm a misogynist but it turns out that 85% of women on the planet seem to agree with me every single woman I've ever met in real life agrees with me I have no female hate at all I've never had NE negative interaction with women ever yes you have with who what about the BBC journalist it came to your compound Lucy yes oh I've never had a negative interaction with a female I don't think she was a fan I think she was how would categorize that as a negative interaction well she seemed to follow me around for a long time I think she was a little bit there lots of women Andrew there are lots of women I know personally there are lots of women who find you incredibly offensive I don't think so right it's their right to it's your right it's your right to not care but the idea that somehow you're this beloved person for the world's females I think is uh not true you are for a certain type of woman who likes to be treated in the way that you like to treat women well let's counter that argument right because the world as I said at the beginning is nuanced am I beloved by all females no but when I'm sat here with someone as prestiged as you who says you're a misogynist and you hate women and women hate you I think you talk in a way that is misogynistic yeah okay well then you make it sound like all women hate me and that's also not the case of course it's a Nuance say old women hate some some women agree with me some women don't agree with me when I said that post about aand Holden a lot of women said Andrew that's actually completely correct she's extremely famous and there's no need for her to be posting video pictures like this at her ripe age I was actually empowering her I believe that female empowerment is in modesty but you don't actually believe in feminism I believe in the idea of you believe in masculinity controlling women no they have to take instructions from you they have to do what you tell them and that is actually what love and relationships are about no I believe that men and women have different roles I believe that we were created differently by God because we are the perfect team I believe that a man who's in his masculine frame is best suited by a woman who's in her feminine frame I believe when we work together we can achieve amazing things whether it's raising children or preserving society and I believe a man has certain jobs and a woman has certain jobs you don't understand this about the things I say when I said there that women make bad decisions in the Tweet you referenced earlier the point I was making is that women are more emotional than men that is their superpower that is fantastic that is a great thing I love female emotionality in the Tweet before you tried to use against me I was talking about how I love woman to be happy all the time smiling all the time while I'm stressed I love female emotionality the reason women are bettered with children the reason women are bettered with children is because they're emotional is their superpower in a position you're not even remembering what you wrote of course it is I said female women are more emotional than men is exactly what I said I'm saying that is a fantastic thing but there is no light without dark so in certain situations the emotionality is positive in certain situations the emotionality is negative we can also argue the same for men because what happens to me is everyone tries to gender my arguments we can actually argue the same with men stoicism male stoicism is positive in certain scenarios it can be negative in others we can come across as unempathetic or not care because we're stoic certain situations it benefits I know people who've told me that their kids who in their late teens they're at schools where the name Andrew Tate is banned nobody's allowed to mention your name because the teachers think that your brand of masculinity is so toxic they are seeing a immediate effect on the way young men behave and not in a good way is that what the teachers think is it yeah well I am actually genuinely concerned by the fact that I've been banned from schools when I do nothing but preach masculine strength and Excellence but then if you actually understand how the society is going and how the world works and all the insanity they're trying to push on all of us I can understand why they banned me because I speak the truth if I was wearing a wig Pierce and lipstick and telling young boys to remove their genitals would I have been banned from schools no they would have say no you can say his name no problem no matter how big I got if I had a wig on and lipstick and I had been castrated medically I would be allowed to talk to the young boys but as soon as I say You're supposed to grow up and get big and strong and if your wife doesn't want a job you need to pay for her it's your job as a man you better find some money then I'm the Public Enemy Number One garbage on that last point you don't say if a woman doesn't want to work and man to take care of it you say a woman shouldn't work I said my woman won't work right I'm talking about my personal experience I said any girlfriend of mine because I'm an extremely fortunate financial position I was before Romania took everything of course I have hundreds of millions of dollars so because I am in my position I would not want my woman to work I think there's more important things she can do if you have hundreds of millions of dollars where you said you had a worth of 17 million no I said they took 17 million years where's the rest uh they must have taken it I think they have it or maybe I lost it I think I lost it somewhere you you've never had hundreds of millions of dollars of course not we haven't have of course not you said they took all your assets exactly well did they or didn't they of course they took everything I mean they'll be watch watching this are they to assume that there are hundreds of millions more dollars they haven't got yet watching that's right they absolutely everything you have it all right but again is that all just a smok and mirrors is that all just the the top G stuff that you play up to which is has no bearing on reality I was the most Googled man on the planet I was the most relevant man amongst 18 to 35y old males which are the highest earning and spending people on the planet do you really think that I am not I can't pay my bills Pierce right now yeah okay some paying them for you correct you're right someone's paying them for me you're right my girl's got a job she works at Starbucks exclusive Andrew tapes girl top G's girl works in Starbucks to pay the rent I've been exposed see again I don't know what to believe when you say stuff like that well I'm telling you my friend that the remaining States I think you deployed deliberate smoke in mirrors because you think it plays up to the brand Romanian State have taken all of my money and I'm just you know getting by MH that's what's happened do you worry about your impact on young men I think that I like I said I'll be completely honest I think a lot of what you say they should be hearing Y and I have tangible proof every day when I walk around that they are listening to everything you say but there is other stuff you say where I don't want my sons especially in that impressionable late teenage to be listening to that correct and that's a I don't want my daughter to grow up and think that actually her only success in life will come if she's at home as some kind of servant to her man well that won't be her only success but that's an actual that's a very professional question and I'll give a very professional answer I have a massive responsibility with great power comes great responsibility and I understand that young men do listen to everything I say I do think I say good things but you also made a very pertinent point there you talked about the impressionable age of a teenager and it's very easy for a teenager with their hormones and their lack of life experience to take the things I say and weaponize them and use them in the incorrect context however that is not my fault you could argue that 16 17 year olds could look at anything on the internet and misunderstand it you could argue that all of this transgender garbage and all these rappers talking about killing each other and all these drill artist talking about stabbing their enemies could be misunderstood by a 16-year-old so that's not my fault however on that I totally agree so I have a massive responsibility and you are held to a different account actually to a lot of those rappers absolutely right there's no question I mean the far of me was when John Legend rewrote the lyrics to Baby It's Cold Outside because apparently encouraged sexual assault but wouldn't say a negative word about any of the disgustingly misogynist and and actually very violent lyrics of his rap friends that to me is total hypocrisy and it is HP hypocritical however unlike all of these other people I have taken into account my massive power and my massive responsibility and I try to make sure that I use my words as carefully as possible so that they cannot be misconstrued or misunderstood can I make sure that no teenager on the planet who listens to me ever misunderstands me ever no I can't do that but I am doing my very best what do I actually talk about what do I actually say I what I do is I come come along and let me give you the broad overview of my message you're a man so your life sucks it's always going to suck and it's going to be pain you're going to do nothing but suffer you're going to suffer as a nobody or going to suffer the pain it takes to become actually most men don't have that but that you're going to suffer as a nobody because trust me nobody suffer or you're going to suffer the pain it takes to become great life is not supposed to be a happy picnic you're supposed to get up work hard dedicate yourself get strong get rich go through whatever it takes to become somebody of significance That's My overall message and I believe it's a positive you got to get rich to be happy no in fact most of the super rich people I know in life are incredibly unhappy really so you're setting a kind of full Dream well I don't a lot of rich people are miserable have you ever seen a rich person give Mone lot of people who have very little money can be very happy have you ever seen a rich person give their money away yes of course okay do you give all your money away will I make you happier Pierce I don't know do you want the Romanian state to take it all I didn't smile that day and let me tell you that the reason I tell about men to become financially successful is for two reasons one because you have a job as a man to protect and provide you can do neither of those things if you are broke that's the first reason and the second reason I actually preach to young men to become as financially successful as possible is a greater broader reason and I believe we've entered a very interesting stage in humanity where the Matrix has finally cracked three or four years ago there were certain narratives you could not talk against but with Elon Musk owning X and now we have Rumble we have a lot more information on the internet people are starting to tell the truth about many different subjects there's a whole bunch of them we can name and I like the idea of people who are free thinking with a free mind we're not Matrix control making as much money as possible because it takes money to win Wars and I want these people to be financially successful that's why I tell all of my fans who believe in me to become as rich as possible because they understand that everything the government does is lie to them we need Finance you use the word truth there I don't think it's necessarily that people want to promote truth they want to promote their opinions often people's opinions on facts can be very different people can take the same set of facts and different opinions doesn't mean it's the truth right well that's true but I don't believe in this my truth crap right neither do I there are facts which have to be accepted then you can have opinion about them you and I can disagree about all sorts of opinions but actually not facts okay but I can argue this point where the Matrix comes out with a fact and all the opinions countering that fact are censored and they are destroyed then that fact becomes de facto truth because it's the only version of reality which exists to be ingested by the mind so you still need varing opinions on all public do you think that what you uh let's let's put it this way sure you would have relationships with women and encourage to take part in webcam sexual stuff no well actually yes why are we going back to this because there's one question I want to ask you about it right and both sides made a lot of money sure right okay and in most cases because they haven't complained in most cases you would assume it was a mutually beneficial transactional relationship right I can assume that because thousands of women have been through this and most of them haven't come forward and complained about the way they were treated there was transactional but was it moral do you think what you've been making money from Park the illegality aspect to one side do you feel it was moral 10 years ago I helped women promote their profiles on the internet correct 10 years ago firstly I have not been involved with it for seven years it's not how I make money I haven't touched it for a very long time seven years is a long time you made a lot of money from it I made some money from it a long time ago how much some money I can't even remember millions millions perhaps Millions so you made millions of pounds a long time ago well hang on it's important you made millions of pounds from sexual webcam activity where you and the woman doing the webcams would make money you accept that no what I did is there is how you made money no a long time ago and I talked about this at length on many different podcasts I don't hide it I said a long time ago 10 years ago I helped women with the tax side and the technical side and the promotion ofes the promotion of their profiles on certain websites and I said about this and I said I haven't been involved with it for seven years the only reason this is even coming up again is because I'm monumentally famous because nobody cares we're in B Pier we're in Bucharest Romania do you understand that there is a video chat studio with girls talking to men online right there outside that window in fact there's about 10 or 15,000 women in this city who do that job now and the fact that I had some I dipped my toe in it 10 years ago isn't even significant I'm only asking if you think it's moral do I think it's moral because you speak in such a morally self-righteous way now do you think that that was moral well I wasn't religious back then but let me sit and because you're now you you converted to Islam correct you're a Muslim they have you know a code of behavior do you think that that fell short of I have to answer as a professional and as a professional I would say judging by my current code no I do not think that women being naked on the Internet is moral however there is like so you made money immorally you can admit that it's nuanced like all things peers at the time I was atheistic I know that some of my girls talked men away from suicide a lot of men are ridiculously lonely I would also say a lot of the lessons I know about men and how they think and how lonely and sad they can be and how difficult life is as a man actually came from that era because I saw a lot of very successful men with a wife and with kids and with money pouring their heart out to some 20-year-old they never met about how sad they were I learned a lot about the world and I know that a lot of suicide was prevented and I made a lot of women millionaires but would I do it now no however I'm in a very different situation now I'm a different person I'm religious I'm also extremely financially successful please understand Piers I come from Marsh Farm Luton I came from one of the worst areas inside of the UK I could have stabbed someone every all of my friends are breaking into cars breaking into houses most of my friends are in jail what did I do I promoted accounts on the internet didn't didn't sell crack didn't sell drugs didn't rob anyone didn't shoot anyone and now because I am successful I'm going to be held to this moral standard by people who grew up in fancy homes with white picket fences and went to private school I am from Marsh Lon and the biggest crime I committed was completely legally promoting internet profiles there are people around me who did follow for far less no no you're only going to be held to the standard of the religion you've converted to which you've already when you take the shahada all your former fins are already said would look at that as immoral when you take the shahada all of your former sins are erased and I actually encourage you to find the light and convert to Islam how you take thank you very much thank you sir
