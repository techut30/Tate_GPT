all of the ideologies which are being pushed by The Matrix are designed to destroy something Andrew Tate goes on a massive attack to the crypto Community yeah I'm a Bitcoin maximalist that's you that's your personality that's everything you are he shares a story he's never told in a secret he's never shed I know a killer when I see one and him of a Mexican standoff at the back of the car they set me up when I put my bag in the trunk at the beginning he explains to you step by step how you can get rich and he exposes feminism and defends himself against misogyny feminism is probably the most misogynistic movement on Earth because what it does is it makes women into competitors with men in Realms where they can't compete with men before I tell you the wild discussions we had I'm giving away Â£30,000 worth of exclusive prizes just for listening to both parts of this Andrew Tate launch all you have to do is find the secret question hidden in these two episodes what defines sexual consent bro you said fuing bring it you told me to bring it well it's forever changing isn't it I think if we're watching this I think everyone at home knows what rape is I think everyone at home knows what an actual rape is and how heinous and disgusting that is and I'm the first person as a masculine man to say that rapist should face a death penalty I'll say it myself a woman regretting consensual sex years later is not rape I think that's cheapening the idea of rape I think it's it's insulting to the women who have genuinely been raped I think to sit and say that rape can now include a woman having a one night stand demanding handbags not getting handbags being upset that she can't get handbags still not calling the police seeing that man by another woman a handbag a year and a half later and then deciding it was rape I think that is extremely insulting to the unfortunate women who have suffered genuine sex crime I think it's disgusting I also think that most women and most men know what sexual consent is I have daughters I have a lot of daughters and sons but I want to make something clear because one of the things that's used against me most often is people say I said women bear some responsibility for getting raped which is not what I said what I said is that we're adults and we must all bear responsibility for the situations we find ourselves in if a woman is walking her dog in the park and is raped that's disgusting and that's not her fault what I was talking about was a particular scenario in which a woman will go out with a man get drunk with a man spend all night with a man go to the man's house continue to drink have sex with the man then years later decide that it was rape my argument would be if you don't want to have sex with a man do not get drunk with him and do not go lay in his bed that's my argument I have daughters and I would say do not get drunk with men and lay in their bed if you don't want to have sex with them ever don't do that because you're going to give the man the impression now I'm not saying the man can rape her I'm not saying that I'm saying that you're putting yourself in a position where rape is more likely to happen if I decide to walk through the worst area of town with a million dollars in cash yeah nobody should rob me you're right it's a crime to rob me but am I making myself a robbery Target am I making myself easy to rob it would be irresponsible for me to do such a thing so I think that the best way to protect women in these scenarios is not to do what the feminists are doing which is to come along and try and create this Ideal World well men should know not to rape we do we know not to rape we also know not to kill and women should know not to lie but guess what people are imperfect and people do bad things so what you have to do is take personal responsibility and protect yourself against the possibility of these things I think that the reason sexual consent has now become such a Hot Topic is yes there's Bad actors doing bad things of course men and women but truthfully I think a lot of this is happening because we've removed some of the basic societal Norms a woman wouldn't get drunk with a man and go to a man's house and lay in the man's bed and kiss the man and take all her clothes off and then not want to sleep with a man 40 years ago so the consent line wasn't as blurred because it was you're not my husband or you're not my boyfriend I don't want to go anywhere near you it was pretty clear line so then the line had to be jumped over by a predator but now the line's all messy because of the immorality of people male and female so now it's very difficult where do you draw the line what if she gives consent but she was drunk that doesn't count how is the man supposed to know is he supposed to get out a blood alcohol measure and and make her BB oh sorry your yes doesn't count the whole Line's messed up because morality is destroyed if you destroy morality then now there can't be a line so I can't answer the question nobody can and the law is coming along trying to find the line in all these individual cases in these huge court cases trying to find the line where there's no morality at all I would argue and I know this is difficult to say but I'm going to say it if my daughter came to me and said I was raped before on my way to get my gun I'd say tell me the story and if she said I met a man and I was dating him for many weeks and I went out with him and I started drinking with him and then I went to his house and we continued to drink and it was a party and then we started kissing and I took all my clothes off and then we started having sex and then uh and then I decided I didn't want to have sex anymore I'm like I can't truthfully shoot this man in the head anymore why did you do all of that why didn't you just say no and I'm talking about my own daughter here I but I don't know if I'm allowed to say this without the world having a mental breakdown because we live in a world now where nothing is nuanced you can't make a nuanced point you can't talk about how complicated a subject is everyone wants black and white it's difficult what sexual consent is anymore because when you remove morality there's no longer a line I don't know it's hard this is why I've settled down with my 11 wives because you you can't trust anyone let's imagine I meet a brand new girl and let's imagine we have a happy relationship un let's imagine we're together for nine months and let's imagine we have sex 100 times and let's imagine I don't buy her a BMW let's imagine and let's imagine she texts me and says I want a BMW and I say no and let's imagine she texts me and says if you don't buy me a BMW I will go to the police and say you raped me so imagine she admits wish she from Peterboro where I live well let's imagine she admits via text to the crime she admits what she's going to do for a car and I still refuse to buy her a car when she goes to the police and makes that complaint I will still be arrested I will still be demonized in the media I will still have to go to court I will still have to go through a trial I will still spend $3 million in legal fees despite her admitting to the fact she is lying for a car I will still have my reputation decimated my life will be damaged I'll be stressed to the max I'll have legal fees I'll go through all of this all because I didn't buy her a car despite her admitting the crime because I'm a man and even worse I'm a famous man and even worse than that I'm a masculine man so I'm the enemy of the Matrix so how can a man even fairly and safely have a relationship anymore where is sexual consent I don't know I had sex with her 100 times was she drunk one of those times I don't think so do I alcohol breath test her every single time no she's now saying she was drunk I'm saying well she came over my house at 11:30 p.m. we went straight to bed I don't know I didn't know is I don't drink I haven't drunk a drop of alcohol in a year and a half yeah but she was drunk prove it do you have the blood alcohol test that she was drunk no neither do I but she says she was drunk so she says the consent isn't real so you still have to go to a trial but she admitted she lied for a BMW trial we have we have evidence to the contrary because you said on Rob moris podcast that women can't park and then BBC rapist rapist rapist rapist rapist rap bro what the you can't live a life anymore and the scenario I've just described to you is 100% accurate so how are you as a man now you ask me what sexual consent is I don't no there is no sexual consent anymore let me let me change my answer my answer was there's no longer a clear line of sexual consent because of diluted morality I'm going to change the answer as a man there is never consent because if it can be snatched from you retrospectively then you never had it you never owned it if I give you something and I can snatch it back off of you at any time do you own it no you're borrowing it you can borrow consent as long as you never annoy that female at any point in the future ever good luck that's what a line of sexual consent is for a man so as a man in the Western World you have zero consent and even if you have all of the proof I made the point about the text for the BMW because that's very important you can have CCTV footage you can have all her texts you can have everything they will still destroy you in the media so it doesn't matter your reputation still TI you lose your job lose your bank accounts they'll still take they'll still take everything from you so there is no sexual consent anymore for a man in the west it doesn't exist so here's a paradox I've just picked up out of that sure and that is everything you said about what the media will do to you has made you bigger than Jesus Christ like you are bigger than Jesus right now yeah it it's made me massively it has made if it didn't work like that you wouldn't be as big as you are correct but I'll also argue I'm in a fortunate situation because 99% of men who was hit like I was hit couldn't have done what I've done and I'll tell you why firstly there's the mental aspect every man thinks he's tough till it's going on to when you have the BBC attacking you attacking your mother attacking your family attacking the mothers of your children when your kids are getting kicked out of school when reporters are following your old mother around when they've closed all your bank accounts down when they're trying their very best to call all your ex-girlfriends and build up cases that don't exist when they're printing lies about you when you know you can go to jail at any moment for nothing that's a lot of mental stress most most people I'd argue couldn't deal with that mental stress next financially most people have a job and your job is gone and you're broke if you have your own business you can't get customers or clients most people I'm in a very fortunate financial situation where my finances are hard to touch and very difficult to damage in fact they've been trying for a very long time to take down my schools the war room that's not even my main money my main money is other things I even know about I can't be damaged I'm actually in the NBA I'm an NBA player never broke again so because of that I'm also fortunate and I'm a very good speaker with a very large platform and they've tried to cancel me and ban me which they've done normally that makes someone go away I don't go away they've tried and I don't go away I'm on other platform so I can speak if I was a normal person and I got hit with that car garbage I wouldn't be bigger than Jesus Christ I'd be destroyed I'd have no money I'd have no job I'd be able to get no customers I'd have no social media I wouldn't be able to tell my version of the truth and they'd be printing lies about me endlessly and my add all that on top of the other mental pressure I'd be suicidal and they wouldn't care they think it was funny 99% of men who if they've gone through what I've gone through would be a mess so I pulled it off it's true but I speak to all the men out there at home telling you you have no consent because if it happens to the the average man he's done he is done happens to footballers they're famous and they lose their contracts they lose everything it's crazy there's no such thing as sexual consent in the West for a man anymore I didn't even realize that until you asked me that question I thought it was blurred because of morality but after analyzing it it turns out it doesn't exist at all which is even worse there's no such thing as sexual consent as a man how are you supposed to live your life I guess you just don't talk to women at all I guess you just don't reproduce right if you have no kids you have nothing to live for you just sit there and play video games be a be a good slave pay your taxes that's it I guess that's what they want and then they wonder why the birth rate's declining they wonder why they have to import all these third worlders because no one has kids anymore well how can you have kids if you can't have a wife how can you have kids if who can't have sex we're everyone in this room and everyone watching this podcast exists because a man went up to a woman said hello and they had sex that's what happened now if you even go up to a woman you're a sexual predator if you go up and say excuse me I think you're beautiful that's somehow is that's why we're all here the level of Matrix attack do people understand what's going on here Society is so fundamentally broken you can't even exist as a man anymore your only hope the only answer is to be such a Charming fantastic individual that women do not want to betray you and attack you which I guess is an answer I mean it's worked for me but you're relying on the sensibilities of other people it's kind of a scary scenario to know that the woman you take care of and love might turn on you any moment and she can and she has all the benefit of the doubt I don't know if this is true or not I'm just going to say in fact it must be true if a woman goes into a police station and makes an accusation against a man with no evidence no evidence six years ago I had sex with a man who him I have no text messages from him I have no video of it happening I have no video of me going to his house I don't remember where he lives I don't remember the car I was in I don't remember anything I was drunk but I had sex with this man and I regret it he raped me zero evidence of any kind that man would be questioned and arrested I'd argue if I go into a police station and say I was robbed I don't remember where I don't know what they took I don't know when it happened but I was robbed they go what do you want me to do with this what do you mean Rob by who what what just no no evidence just just random accusations it's scary then let's go deeper down the rabbit hole do women hate men now if you're going to push this feminist narrative and you're going to tell women they have to compete with men and a woman's going to buy into that and she's going to see herself in competition with men inside the workforce or inside Society in masculine Realms is she GNA feel hateful or resentful towards men to a degree I'd argue she would because a woman in a feminine realm will destroy a man as she should she has all the advantages and I'll sit here and say that women in feminine Realms outperform men 100% of the time by extension in masculine Realms men will outperform women 100% of the time so if you're going to try and turn women into men what you're going to have is they going to have short broke emotional men who are going to lose to big strong tall stoic men and then they're going to be resentful of the men who do better than them and then you're going to give that resentful person power to destroy any man's life at a whim without evidence I'm just talking out loud I don't know is that scary it is kind of scary and then you come along and say okay well we've tried to turn these women into men and they're not doing that well so we're going to do diversity hires and hire the women over the men even though the men outperform them and if you look at her wrong she can destroy your life at random and you have to pay your taxes go build a Roes and you're not allowed an opinion and if they're fat you have to find them attractive otherwise you're a misogynist and your kids are gay don't say anything about it we go jail Freedom democracy don't you love we live in a free Society isn't it great Freedom it's my new book money Matrix money Matrix free societ we live in a free Society it's so free here I feel free do you let's go deeper down the rabbit hole talk about money Matrix it just reminded me of something how do most tech companies make money today they give away a free product and they use your personal information you are the product you are the product that's right so you use Facebook or use Instagram you use a free product and they get personal information about you and your habits and that and they take that information and they monetize it so The Logical extension of that fact would be that the more information they obtain about you the better they will be at monetizing that information so that means that large companies are trying their very best to know everything about you the harder they survey you the better their surveillance the more profitable they will be and Company's primary objective is to be as profitable as possible meaning that Tech companies and large companies by extension which are basically government because government have the fingers in all of them want to spy on you as much as possible the reason they want to do that is to build a pattern of your behavior and they use that pattern of your behavior to predict how you're going to spend money or predict how they can make you spend money if we show him this type of advert at this time for this length of time he's more likely to spend than if we don't because of all the other millions of people who fit his profile this was the most reactive type of advertisement if you accept all of that to be true then you must accept the next logical extension to that which means if they have all this information on your patterns and how they can make money from you they must be trying to change your patterns huge news years in the making my brand new book that my Publishers refuse to publish money Matrix beat the money system and build generational wealth understand the three main ways that the banks productize you and make money from you you'll be able to turn that system against itself build generational wealth and multiple streams of recurring income it's all at moneyat docash and if you're quick the first few hundred registrants and buyers will receive many special bonuses from me the brand new money maker Summit 3-day special event meet me at a champagne reception meet me at a multi-millionaire networking dinner go now money matrix. this is huge they must have pattern a type of person who is worth $159 and pattern B type of person who is worth $922 how do we make the pattern B people act like the pattern a people what do they do different how can we change the algorithm or the app to make the pattern b's be more like the pattern A's so we can make more money if the goal of a business is forever profit they want a forever survey and they want an ideal customer and if they understand your patterns of behavior they must be trying to influence your patterns of behavior the next logical extension to that is we're living in a world we're not not only are we being spied on with absolutely everything every single thing we use is trying to change us and change how we think and change how we act could we argue that's how you make your hundreds of millions change your people against the Matrix to the free one speech 100% so you have me who is particularly eloquent and concise concise is one that you are not compendious I'm good at talking but now we have machines doing it so we talk about the future nii people say what do you think about AI I think AI is going to change how we all think and act I'm not worried about what the machines are going to do I'm worried about what you're going to do you as a person I'm worried about what the people are going to do when the AI becomes good enough to truly turn turn the pattern B's into the pattern A's how do we make all the people who understand the truth believe Andrew is a human trafficker how do we make people believe the news again what disaster do we need have need to come up with what words do we need to type in which order in which order do we have to show them the different articles for it to be a logical continuation in their brain for them to come to the conclusion we want them to come to I'm not worried about what AI is going to do on its own I'm wor about it's going to do to all of us because that's how they're making money now is by surveying us and controlling us and yeah I'm one man with a mouth and I'm pretty good but to compete against machines into the future I'm only going to lose so when you talk about money Matrix it just reminded me about how surveillance capitalism I guess that's the only capitalism we have now it's surveillance capitalism I guess I I would like to and I'm doing this on the fly so I don't know but what is communism communism is is spying on absolutely everything somebody does to make sure they adhere to the correct Creeds so they can make a living surveillance capitalism is spying on Absolut everything somebody does so you can make as much money as possible from them but if they don't do the right things you'll delete their ability to exist as a human I'm sure somebody with a little bit more time than I could draw up the comparisons between surveillance capitalism and communism are we kind of reaching the same place you're spied on absolutely we don't even have capitalism anymore in the true definition of the word where do we where do we have free Fair markets and free competitive forces that's right and if a government's primary objective every single day is to get more and more control which is all it is it all ends in communism anyway is surveillance capitalism just another path towards the same thing every day the government passes new laws every week every month whatever have you ever seen the government take a law away so over time they just get more and more and more and more control they don't take laws away they just add new ones on top where does that end if you have 100 Marbles and I take one away every day it ends at zero doesn't matter if it takes a while but that's where we end up right so the governments are all going to try and end up with us in some form of slavery you can call call communism you can call it something else but this money Matrix you're talking about surveillance capitalism I don't think that's far off communism anyway I don't think anybody you're right we have no free and fair markets we have no freedom of speech we just talked about the freedom of society how garbage that is democracy is a scam that's a lie because they influence to control the media if the if the voting machines work so what do we have besides God Only God can save us now my friend better start praying cuz we ain't got anything else there's nothing else to believe in what else you going to believe in it's it's scary also interesting you say about the money Matrix the average person stands so little chance of being financially free it is ridiculous how screwed most people are they don't even know how screwed they are you know let me take something that's really hilarious this mly made me laugh out loud I don't have Facebook so I'm banned but I saw a Facebook post po my mom shared it with me someone someone and it was a 17-year-old who was happy that they got accepted into college that's the biggest joke I've ever heard of so wait you are happy you've been accepted to give them money imagine I said I was accepted to buy a Big Mac I'm trying to give them money you accept me oh thanks so you can go to school school and learn nothing learn nothing you know what I love to do with people who go to UNI I love it cuz I don't have a degree right and I'm obviously monumentally more successful than all these nerds and every once in a while I meet somebody who whole identity is invested in their their learning and they talk to me about how important it is blah blah if you want to be a doctor or I don't want to have to point out the obvious here if you want to be a doctor you go to school I get it okay cool but whenever someone's in uni I'm like why do you go to UNI they go oh cuz I want to learn things I said did you go uni today yeah what did you learn today what do you mean no today today what did you learn today they can never answer the question it's great ask them start asking people what did you learn today and watch them just fumble and then they realize well I didn't learn anything on one day I probably didn't learn anything on the week which I probably didn't learn anything the whole time whole thing's been a SC all waste of time then you get in massive Monumental debt debt that's the money Matrix you come out of school you're in you're in debt it's over it's over for you you're never going to make it you've lost the game on level one you lost it's kind of interesting that I had a thought experiment with somebody and I said you could only get loans for school because if you could get loans for anything you wanted nobody would choose [Music] school because they can't exist in a free and fair market they have to keep a monopoly over the ability to insave children with debt otherwise no one will choose them because there's no value in it and everyone knows there's no value in it but how Matrix minded you have to be to actually still be happy about the idea you got accepted to a college I I I I nearly laughed I these people have no idea how all this stuff works they don't have a clue Rich get richer I'm sure you understand poor get poorer inflation inflation inflation that sounds like higher house prices to me good thing I own good thing I own a bunch yeah sounds like higher share prices good thing I own a bunch of that oh you can't buy groceries I'm sure that's very hard we don't have to worry about those things we own all the assets the rich get richer and the poor get poorer and there's no way to stop it and I also feel like because I think societies we need God and we talked about how messed up Society is I also feel like we're living in the last years where there's a a hole in the Matrix where there's any degree of social Mobility I think we're going to end up back at feudalism there's going to be Kings see what the talk my friend how many Ferraris no diamond watch arguing about our Diamond W they'll be us and they'll be everyone else right now there's still a degree of social Mobility where if you're intelligent and you're perspicacious and you're inde indefatigable and you work hard and you manage to find a gap and you really dedicate yourself and you try your best you can make enough money to get out in 20 years the rich are going to be rich and the poor are going to be poor and it's done it is done because the average price of a house is going to just continue to Skyrocket the wages are not going to follow it you're never going to own any assets the assets going to be owned by all the rich people you're going to be paying us rent it's over and there's another thing I find interesting because people come to me often question I get asked most is Andrew I lack motivation you have 10 years left to save your bloodline from Eternal slavery and you lack motivation you are born to lose sir you are a loser all of your ancestors who fought saber-tooth tigers should have just laid down and died because they fought their best for you to be born so you can jack off the PornHub during the last few years where you stand a chance to save your last name from Eternal surom you are a [Â __Â ] and you deserve to be poor the last thing you should lack in the mess of the world today is motivation because you are running out of time and I'm telling you as a rich man who made it out I can see the Gap is closing I can see it so you should certainly see it I'm above in the clouds looking down on the hole closing in you're down below looking up watching it close and you lack motivation to build a ladder oh well maybe tomorrow maybe government Will Save Me Maybe if I vote for the Liberals they'll give me money slave Minds clowns fools the last thing you should lack in the world today is motivation because truly people are running out of time and I find that extremely interesting that not only when you go to college do you end up in a bunch of debt not only do you end up owing a bunch of money even worse you waste time you waste years for a dream and the Matrix is very good at this it h it dangles a carrot all the time get good gcses get good in college get a good degree then you'll be rich pay off your mortgage you'll be rich just pay off your student loans don't worry just keep working the carrots coming you'll get it one day when I was 16 when I saw the Ferrari I knew this was a lie I was like there's no way that man next time you see a rich guy go up to him and say how'd you get rich I've never heard anyone say University ever I've never heard anyone say it's a lie it's a scam when I was 16 I saw the guy in the Ferrari I was like I'm going to college and he isn't and he ain't going to work he knows something I don't know I knew at 16 everything they tell me was a lie but there's still people who think they have five years years to waste in college five years I'm 37 let's conservative conservatively estimate I make for myself quarter million dollars a day let's say five years ago I was probably making 20 grand a day that's the difference five years can make five years and they're going to sit there do what read a book from 22 years ago go party oh fraternity bro what's really scary is this I'm 37 I grew up on a council estate I was broke for most of my life I made all my money myself and even I have disdain for the poor because I look at them and go you didn't try at all I did it with all of the pain I went through and all the problems I had while also fighting and becoming a kickboxing world champion I still managed to do it you started at a higher bracket than me you started from a middle-income home your dad was you had food I didn't have food and I was a world champion how did you fail so massively and I look at them and just think of them as you're an idiot and if I feel that imagine how the elites look at us imagine you're born into a lineage a bloodline that been in charge of the banks forever imagine how you view poor people you think you give a [Â __Â ] whether they live or die I'm talking about someone who's only been Rich for 10 years and when someone comes and complains to me about being broke I'm like oh you're a dummy you didn't even try so imagine you were born Filthy Rich and your family's always been rich and you're told about how your family's always controlled everything because you're smarter than everybody else imagine how much disdain the elites truly have for the common man and I'm talking as a common man who made a little bit of money then you start to understand how this world's really working because they don't give a [Â __Â ] about the common man if you say to the elites if you pour third worlders into this nation you will make 3% more per year however the common man will have to deal with crime rape murder drugs human trafficking he'll sit there and go I don't care about the Common Man 3% okay doesn't care why would he care then you have a community where the only people who can protect it left are the men the men who care about their daughters care about their wives but those men have to be masculine men brave men well they're under assault we discussed that for the last two hours so now they're afraid all the buildings look the same anyway why don't we just move let's just move let's just let's just Scurry away then you start to lose the major cities of your nation this hypothetical Nation the major cities start to fall everyone starts saying stupid things like it's a nice country if you stay away from the cities you know what's a nice country if you stay away from all the cities Afghanistan I can go hide in the forest in Afghanistan with a little tent just sit there by myself I probably be fine I probably wouldn't get drone strike I'm on kabo and they don't seem to understand this and then they hide and they run away and eventually they're crushed and it's over and the whole nation Falls and the great thing about globalists being globalist is that they have the whole globe and then all the all the globalists get on a private jet with their families fly to the other place that they haven't destroyed and they find a way to continue to profit off the burning trash sheep that they just abandoned they don't care 3% more profit doesn't matter common man doesn't matter and I'm telling you that they think like this because I catch myself and I have to correct myself thinking like this I have there's a a guy I get this all the time people come out to me and say can you make a video from my cousin he loves you da and I always refuse I don't make videos I might make a picture but I don't make videos anyway this particular guy showed me a picture of the person like you a picture of my cousin I looked at his cousin he must about 22 and he was standing in a crowd at a festival holding a pint and a plastic glass and my instant thought was this guy's a [Â __Â ] this guy's an idiot he's 22 I guarantee he's not a billionaire I bet I to sit down with him and say how much money you got none why are you there the Gap is closing the elites hate you you're no longer have sexual said you're a permanent criminal in the eyes of the law they're here to decimate you in your entire bloodline you're 22 at the height of your capabilities the height of your energy you heal like Wolverine it is Friday are you making money what are you doing oh there's this band I really want to see this band then you I guess you just deserve to lose friend I guess you're just an idiot and I don't feel sorry for you I guess you're just a dummy and that's how I feel feel so imagine how the elites feel we're scum to these people we are I'm not a rich man I'm just a poor man with loads of money I'm from a luten counsil I wear diamond watches bro you understand yeah I'm just a poor man with billions of dollars but it's scary when you start to understand how all these things really work and I don't think the average man at home understands this and if you start to understand it all the last thing you will La is motivation how can you lack motivation how can an antelope in the jaws of a tiger say I lack motivation I'm tired I'm horny I want to jerk off bro you're they're they're ripping out your throat in real time you're bleeding out fight fight [Music] back and then the Tigers like me are like bro you're going to get eaten going to eat you that's what we're going to do I don't know what else I'm supposed to do I don't it's kind of like you probably have this problem as well I don't know if you have this problem do you ever wake up and think I don't need any more money but there's [Â __Â ] all else to do yeah every day yeah so you just end up making millions what's what's better than making something out of nothing Financial Alchemy absolutely yeah so why do I up and go let me do the math if I never worked again I could spend $42 22,000 a day for the rest of my life I have all the cars do I need more money no you know let me go have a coffee let me let me go let me try and chill out today and within 22 minutes I'm back on my laptop working there's nothing else to do there's nothing else to do and I can't stop myself working as a person who doesn't need money and then there's people with no money who don't work it blows my mind which is why the winners are winners and the losers are losers losers do a little bit of work and rest winners work as hard as possible and worry they're not working hard enough it it's just a separation of of personality types and and and it's almost like you can't save these people I have something I I sent in my email recently I said you could give the average man a brand new Ferrari and a road map and a coffee and a full tank of gas and tell him the Destination Success and halfway along the drive he'll quit cuz it's too far matter how well you set it up for people they'll quit I have this the same with my online educational platform my school it's $49 a month it's less than a Starbucks and I will teach you how to make money online you can escape the matrix you can get out through the hole before it closes you can be geographically free you can live in Thailand you can make money from your computer it costs $49 you have absolutely nothing to lose I made it cheap enough for everybody to be able to join and people will sit there and go and then put on Netflix what more I've given you a Ferrari a full tank of gas I've given you the latte I've given you a road map giving you a hul girl to sit next to you and play songs and do selfies I'm giving you everything just drive the car no yeah it's far I don't have motivation DDE you're a loser you are a loser if you do not win you lose what do you call someone who loses a loser that is an underused word loser my brother and I use it all the time this person thinks this he's a loser what do you mean he's a loser look at him he's a loser he lost name a competition I'd beat him at anything Uno marbles a fight to the death you name it I'll decimate this loser oh he thinks I'm a human tra oh hey with the loser give a he's a loser all these losers out here another thing and then they then they say this is what another thing that's amazing to me about motivation I don't feel motivated news flash neither do I sometimes you're not going to always feel like doing it you have to do it anyway cuz it's your duty to do it because you don't want to to be a [Â __Â ] loser that's the whole point if you felt like doing it all the time then there would be no magic to it the magic is that you do it regardless of how you feel that's the whole point of it all what do you mean you need motivation you don't have you don't need motivation you have a duty to not be a loser anymore because the hole in the sky is closing $49 will give you a ladder well you know we'll play video games born to lose born to lose and then they'll end up voting for some ridiculous party which promises them they won't be a loser anymore and that party will hate people like me and they'll try and put me in jail that's what's going to happen that's the world we currently live in the losers party losers love company they do they vote for it losers love company there are certain political parties and movements out there that convince you that being a loser is okay and then you feel better and you also get to blame others for your loserdom and you feel great you don't have to Tak any personal responsibility I'm not a loser because of me I'm a loser because they did it or this happened blah blah blah blah so they they're attractive to losers and then we end up in a situation we're currently in who's better with women Andre Tate or Tristan Tate Tristan 100% Tristan why I've retired bro I've retired Tristan's the Mr Ladies Man Tristan Tristan and I are the perfect team because we're opposites people think we're the same but we're not we're actually very difficult sorry very different Tristan enjoys life Tristan enjoys life do I enjoy life well you say life is war it is War I don't think I I don't think I consciously very often enjoy anything the things I enjoy are not fun fun things are you enjoying this this is work it's fun I mean I like to talk yeah it's fun it's fun but like if what would give me more satisfaction going to a very expensive restaurant with 10 beautiful women and popping loads of balls of champagne and eating really great food and driving home in a fast car or clearing all my work notifications I think the notifications might give me a higher dopamine hit I'll be perfectly honest that's true trist would love that trist would enjoy the whole thing I'd be there and and I'm he' love the 10 women you me and you'd love the work the work yeah I think you have to be smart enough to realize most things in the world are garbage but stupid enough to enjoy the garbage so I can I can put myself in a frame of mind where I'll sit at that table and I won't enjoy it but I'll sit and say everyone like like me stealing everyone's dreams with the cars I like this is every man's aspiration everyone else at this club wishes they were at this table with the most beautiful women with the nicest cars out outside and the biggest steak and balls of champagne whatever I'll sit there me and I'm cognitive enough to look and say yes this is fun but really it's just because no one else can do it am I actually enjoying it no I'd rather just go home and work I I don't really care but it has to be done just to make other people sad my brother and I my brother and I used to talk about this it was actually we used to say this a few years ago back when I used to drink I don't drink anymore but he'd say are we going to the club tonight I like I don't want to go he goes but Andrew if we don't go other men get girls at their tables because if we go we get every single female in the club at our table I was like yeah I don't want to go and I don't want females near me really but do I want to give them to everyone else no all right then maybe maybe I'm just Petty maybe I'm spiteful who knows but we'd go just so no one else could have any fun but Tristan enjoys life so and and that's what I love about him because if I want to enjoy life I can tap into his energy and he can tap into my energy when things need doing and that's to prison like going to jail that's right that's why we're a very good team but um yeah I I I'm I'm cerebral enough to pretend to enjoy things but if I'm actually honest there's very little I actually enjoy I enjoy fighting I enjoy working I enjoy driving fast cars competitively like racing and stuff besides that I don't care is one of the best things things about having the watches the cars and the Fantasy Life is understanding the reality that that is not the fantasy life I think the best thing about it being honest is that no one else going to happen I be I'm telling you what I enjoy I enjoy having things other people can't have I enjoy using Finance to assert my dominance I enjoy peacocking with my feathers ha I enjoy is that one of the more honest Andre I'll be very honest it's the the lamentation of of losers is beautiful to me I love it I love people complaining about the energy bill and I'm filling up my sf9 going yeah must be really hard oh 200 PBS wow makes me happy I I it's a seting dominance I'm better than you look I have metrics measurable metrics numbers nice and simple you understand numbers is two more than one okay cool right billion I'm lucky you tried your best I love that I think every man does I think that male happiness comes through the feeling of superiority I think men are happy when they feel better I think we're naturally competitive that's why we've always done what we've done why did gask Khan need Vienna bro that's Austria look at map why did he need Vienna it took him probably three months to even hear they were at Vienna by the time he got the message they probably already conquered it why did he need it because he wanted it why do I need the stuff I have because other people can't have it as mine and I think that that's where masculine happiness comes from because I think men are happy when they feel respected and you're going to respect yourself if you look around and you have things other people don't have it's very easy I I don't want to be called arrogant wait sorry I don't give a [Â __Â ] if I'm called arrogant because sure there's people that say he thinks he's so great and I can sit and say yeah you're right I think I'm so great and I know that aners you but let's actually measure and I'll prove to you that I am great I'm not trying to insult anyone I'm not trying to be unlikable I'm saying I am great look get the average man the average statistics put my statistics next to them put it in chat gbt and say which one's greater what do you what do you want I enjoy that feeling why do I walk into the showroom and buy the two available cars that I don't want because it's one man's dream and now another man can't buy them now they're mine that's just it and I think that if every man's honest with himself that's what every man wants if you get away with all the Matrix garbage and all the Matrix has told you all this crap like be humble and all this other garbage throw it away why do you play sports to win to win why do you want to put a ball in a net more times than the other people to show that you're better than them at putting a ball in a net how insignificant an action a ball in a net who cares a much more significant action would be making a bunch of money or being physically stronger or a better fighter or being smarter a quicker talker or being more well-known more respected more influential that's far more important than putting a ball in the net and you'll spend your time putting a ball in the net to prove you're better than other people so don't sit and say that I'm a bad person for proving I'm better than everyone else by all the things I'm doing that's masculine competition by extension the men who do not think like me the losers because you lose if there's a game being played and some men realize it's a battle and some men don't realize there's a battle going on how can they possibly win so some of you men are waking up every day not realizing you're in a forever permanent competition with every single man around you for everything all of the time and that doesn't ever cross your mind and you wonder why you permanently lose well it crosses my mind and that's why I'm beating you women want the men who think this way women want the men who understand this who win that's who women want so you can call it arrogant you can call it egotistical I call it winning I call it realism I call it realistic and the best things about having most of the things I have is that other people can't have them that's the bottom line of it it's the reason why billionaires buy a bigger yacht than the billionaire next to them do do not need an extra 20 feet of deck space they want the biggest yacht in the harbor is the reason why they buy oneof one picassos it's the reason why when Bugatti launch a new car with 0 units they're all sold same day that's why because winners all think the same way and anyone who sits and goes well you should be more humble I hear that sometimes and then I look at who said it to me and whenever someone tells me their opinion this is a habit I give everyone a home whenever somebody gives you their opinion on anything listen to the opinion and then stop and look at who told it to you because you never want to adopt the thinking of somebody who you don't want to be because their thinking made them so whatever they believe in their mind is why they are the person they are so if somebody sits and says to you you should be more humble I sit and think okay my law this is how my brain works he believes I should be more humble that's how his mind operates the closer my mind operates to his mind the more likely I am to be like him who is he and I'll look at the person who said that to me and say no thank you no sir I refuse being humble is that how you got to where you are is that how you got no you you keep humble I'll keep winning you can give because most people who talk about humble all they really want is not be reminded of how they have failed they don't want me to make it clear to them that they have failed they have failed and I even think we talk about like the normal man and the normal life we'll talk about that in a second but normality now is being scoped from all angles I feel like in the 1950s a normal man was a winner the normal man went to a normal job and had a normal family in a normal house in a normal car and a normal life but I feel like the normal person now is two F two parents working children being raised by The Matrix in school being bombarded with propaganda bills barely paid depressed angry anxious watching the BBC AIC normality has been changed from being a winner to being a loser so now being normal is just losing in a way which is so familiar to the people around you are losing that you don't realize you've lost at all cuz everyone is losing so you're like oh I'm just normal no no you've all lost you've all lost none of you are free you've all lost and that's even more scary you can't even be normal anymore to be a winner you have to be exceptional you could be a winner as a normal person only 50 60 years ago now the normal people can't even win because they they're they're grinding down society that the bracket of normal is going further and further down and then you can by extension that makes makes it more scary right because in the 1950s I guess you could wake up and say I just want to be a normal Law Abiding Citizen I want to be normal and I want to follow the law and you'll have a good life and you'll be a winner you'll be respected at home your wife will love you you'll raise children you'll be religious you'll worship God you'll pay your bills normal law abiding if you're a normal law- abiding person not nowadays not only are you broke you can't talk because it's hate speech like if you follow the laws now and you're just a normal law-abiding person not only are you broke you're matrix-m minded listen to the BBC yeah I guess we need to go bomb the hooes Bro who two weeks we now we're bombing the hotis in Yemen cool two weeks ago if you were to go around the world round England and ask people who are the hooes 99.9% of people couldn't even tell you who they were no one even knew who they were now we're convinced we need to blow them up you don't know these people are news don't normal well I guess if the MPS believe guess it's normal I'm in debt it's crazy it's crazy so and it's normal people telling me to be humble so this is this is why it doesn't enter my my mind when they're like you need to be more humble I'm like okay you're a normal person here's your life here's what you believe that's fine I don't believe in that and then I look at my life sorry that now I want to make a point here that's clear though I don't want men to then become delusional don't think you're great when you're not don't be delusional everything I've talked about here is metrics measurable metrics numbers as a man you need to live in the real world or you're not going to be competitive because we're competing in the real world so you need to be able to do amazing things and then be proud of yourself don't sit and think you're great for no reason that is arrogance I'd argue that the normal person who thinks they're so unique and great for no reason is more arrogant than me I was the most famous man in the world I'm allowed to say that was measures it's numbers it's Google so I think the best mental model as a man is to understand that you cannot be normal you need to be exceptional you need to do exceptional things that ties into the exceptionally good and the exceptionally bad like we talked earlier which means you need to be hard on yourself so you can deal with the exceptionally bad and if you start to do all these things they all compound everything I've said across all these hours all tie into each other and you end up in one result you end up in one place which is brutal competence brutal masculine competence there's nowhere else to be and through that brutal masculine competence you can also protect yourself from all the things we were talking about earlier from The Matrix brutal masculine competence will put you in a position of respect where your girlfriend you haven't seen in seven years your ex is called and she goes I respect him too much to rat on him maybe he loves someone else now but I just won't rat on him I respect him only brutal masculine competence can save you law won't save you Law's against you nothing will save you besides your own brutal competence does money make you happy or happier I wouldn't be happy if I was broke money okay so to to not I answered about how having things other people can't have makes me happy so it makes me happy for that reason because it's the vehicle to it because it's the vehicle to it so that's one answer but I'll give another answer money to me now is like hands hear me out I use it all the time and I'm glad I have it I don't consciously think I'm super glad I have hands right maybe occasionally if I see somebody without hands I'm like thank God I have hands but most of the time you just expect it to be there you just use your hands right you expect it to be there you take it for granted if I lost my hands I would be devastated I don't appreciate them as much as I should I should appreciate them more because I could lose them at any point and that's exactly how I view money because if I want something I just take it the world for me is free I try to explain this to people and they don't understand I'm like when you're as rich as me the only way it feels is that everything is free if I see something and I want it I just say y I'll take that it's free it's like it's like imagine there's no more prices on things the only reason I don't take something is because I don't want it or I don't want to deal with putting up with it or putting it somewhere because I already have so much stuff everything is free all the time I go into a clothing store I go into Louis Vuitton yeah give me this this this this give me this bro I'll go into Louis Vuitton and there's a tracksuit and I can't be bothered to try it on I'll buy all four sizes and I'll work out later which one fits and I'll throw the others away everything's free it doesn't matter I don't want to take my jacket off put it on headache so that's that's how it feels now if I had to go back to being broke I would be like you didn't appreciate being rich nearly enough but I'm in the NBA so that can't happen to me but that's how money feels does money make me happy happy okay do my hands make me happy well no I don't wake up and go I'm happy I have hands no but if I didn't have hands I'd probably be a lot less happy it's a requirement for happiness that I just expect to be there what's interesting is we talk about how I expect to just have money beautiful women expect men to just have money even more there's a beautiful girl I knew some years ago blah blah blah I was talking to her and she was saying money won't get a girl a girl doesn't want a man for money unless he's unless she's a prostitute and it's like a purely transactional relationship she said money will qualify you to try every man I talk to has money I'm beautiful I would never speak to a man who has no money in my world all men just have have money I don't know how of course you have money you're a man that's how they view Money beautiful girls think men just have money like like men just have hands and legs and money they don't care how you made it they don't care how hard it was to make they don't care how much stress you go through to get it in her world every single man she has ever replied to on Instagram ever was rich so men just have money and the men who don't have money don't even exist don't exist to her we're sitting in a restaurant and when we left I said how many men were in that restaurant she goes M four five it's like no there was 20 waiters you didn't see there's the kitchen staff at the back you didn't see there's a security guard in the valet out front they're invisible to you they don't even cross your mind you just see the diamond watches that's how they view the world so you're talking about does money make me happy well yeah I think it's a bare minimum requirement of existence I expect to have it like I expect to have my hands by extension beautiful women expect you to just have money if I sat with a beautiful girl and said oh yeah I can't afford that she'd be like what you're a man what do you mean you can't afford it like like you're like like you're missing a dick or something it's just this the world we live in it's the world we live in not you're missing a like you have more than one if it's big enough it can count for two but but but yeah so I couldn't be happy broke and I know I'm always going to have money and I expect to have money all of the time but it's like my hands I don't I don't know how else to explain it it's like my hands I I don't know I couldn't be happy without money I I don't know how a man is waking up and he's happy without money well I think I've written books on money done a lot of exploration I actually think the rhetoric that money doesn't make you happy and life isn't all about money is part of the propaganda of what you call the Matrix in indoctrinating us to concede and and just enough so that we can pay our 50% taxes and pay our interest on all of our loans and then when we die pay 40% of everything that we own cuz if we know that money makes us really happy we'll go and find it which means becoming an entrepreneur and getting out of the system and then that is freedom oh absolutely so I think the smartest thing the rich people ever did was convince the broke people that money doesn't make you happy I think that's nail nail on the head all the rich people like don't worry guys don't worry money doesn't make you happy guys I'm going to keep mine but no worry it doesn't make you happy I promise I promise I'm sad promise you're sad yeah we're both are good luck biggest scam alive because money is freedom it's freedom to drive what you want eat where you want go where you want it's freedom to sleep with who you want I just described it you want a beautiful woman you need money like to to money is freedom if you if you don't want to be a slave which is it's freedom to say no money is freedom to say no it's freedom to talk the truth online and be put in jail and come out still have supercars there's a lot of men who think what I think they can't say it they lose their jobs so you want to say money doesn't buy happiness well then you're saying you're happy to be a slave because only money is going to give you Freedom when they want to try and attack you let they've attacked me they take your money away on purpose so absolutely money's freedom to have an opinion now so it's true so you're yeah exactly so so money absolutely is happiness because freedom is a bare minimum requisite to happiness unless you're happy being a slave and you're right about what rich people did they tried to convince all the people at the bottom that money isn't the answer you're never going to be more happy poor you may as well you may as well be rich I can't think of many scenarios where being rich was a detriment over being poor there's not many even if money can't help you you may as well have it right so I completely agree with you I think money is a bare minimum requirement for happiness especially if you're a masculine man who wants to outcompete then you need money because money is basically everything I think money is the most important thing in the world is health because you have nothing of you're dying second thing is is family and friends who you love and the third is money because it's everything else it's literally everything else is money and they've convinced people the poor people oh yeah he has money but you know I have friends and family who love me so do I so do I that it's like because I have money I don't have friends and family where did I get to spend more time with my friends and family than you do because you're working a slave job they they've they people are sced into thinking that rich people are somehow lacking somewhere else and I'm sure some of them are but not all of them there are some people that have everything they just going to have to accept it some people just have it all they have friends and family and good relationships and love their kids and a bunch of money and if that doesn't anger you to get up and make a bunch of money well I don't know what will you know I always found the one thing that was always amazing to me and this happened to me even just the other day I'll be driving one of my 59 supercars and uh I don't want brag trying and it's raining and it's dark and it's cold and I see people at a bus stop and I'm at the traffic light I'm like it's freezing and it's raining and it's nighttime and you can't afford an Uber if that won't motivate you I don't know what will because the worst thing about the bus isn't the bus it's the time you wait for the bus time is money you're going to sit down there for 45 minutes in the freezing cold and waste your time to save a couple dollars on an Uber and you don't feel Panic to get rich and you're just fine with that and you're going to come home took the bus today bro born to lose born to lose if that won't motivate you especially as my 5.2 L V10 Lamborghini is humming right next to you standing there you're standing with your coat on your hood up Lamborghini's right there wonder when the bus will come been a while today bro bro born to loose so how do you get rich then because whilst I agree with you some people just don't yet know what to do well okay so first thing I want to do is I will teach everyone what to do inside of my school and I'm going to have to plug this school because it's very important and I'll tell you why PL the out I'm going to plug it and I'll tell you why the reason I launched my Academy is not for me to make money I was already rich my Academy exists for the reason we just discussed if you want to be free of mind you need to have money therefore if my goal is to attack and defeat the Matrix I need people who have money who can tell the truth if you're a fan of mine and you work a broky job you're no use to me because you can't speak because you lose your job and you cannot feed your family if you're a fan of mine and you're making millions of dollars then you can tell the truth and you can back me up and support me and you can Echo and you can amplify my sentiments therefore I want all of my fans to make as much money as possible I'm not a philanthropist I'm not doing this because I care about all the people but I'm genuinely from a selfish point of view trying to make all of my fans as rich as possible so we can all tell the truth that is why my Academy is so cheap so anyone can join it and it will teach you how to make money online so if you've SP sat here for hours and listened to everything I've said and agreed with all of it and still have not joined the academy then there's something wrong with you in your mind because you obviously respect my point of view and you obviously know I know what I'm talking about and now I'm telling you I'll teach you how to get rich and you still don't join then you're a broken person and I can't help you or maybe they don't know the link good good point join the real world you can type in the real world on Google and you'll see the link or go to cobratate tocom H you it's there and you can join that's how I teach people to make money online but to give a more overall answer outside of the plug for the Academy which I'll once again reiterate if you're not inside of I don't know what's wrong with you I think the easiest way to make money in the world today is to sell information I think selling information if you were to tell me what's the quickest way to get rich I think providing information or because we live in an attention economy finding a way to solicit attention and then selling information is probably one of the easiest ways to make money in the world today i' like to argue that everybody knows something so I I I like to challenge myself so give me a normie job give me a normal job name a normie job making coffee making coffee boom you're a barista you're a barista now I'm going to tell you how to get rich as a barista because I can think that fast off the top of my head the problem with most people in the world today is not that they do a normal thing it's that they do a normal thing and they don't try to be the best at it so you can be a barista and you can just make coffees or you can be a barista that makes the fancy coffees and can turn over all the cups and do like the the tricks and all the garbage we have a man who became a billionaire from Salt yes from Salt you can all put salt on he did it the best bam so the first thing you need to do is get very good at making coffees that's the first thing you need to do be able to do it in a fancy way then you need to solicit attention well you can make coffees in a fancy way and you can hire a videographer you can then begin to make fancy coffees in a fancy way and you can make it look good with a finalized product and you get a nice video made that's well cut with some fancy music you begin to put them on Instagram and solicit people to watch your Instagram page now you have attention how do you then turn that attention into money after you began to show your fancy coffees well you could let's say put together a course or an academy or write a book on the magic of coffee or the secrets of coffee and you would put a mystery on it don't say I'll teach you how to make coffee no say the secrets of coffee and you'd have a link in your Instagram page and it would be $9 and it would tell people the secrets how to make coffee for example you'd start to sell that for $9 you'd make a couple hundred or a couple thousand not too much but you continue to make fancy coffees people continue to go to your Instagram page and now sell them the secrets of how to make coffee then after people start knowing you as being a barista you start to make these $9 you have 20 $30,000 in the bank what you can do is launch your own coffee brand you can go alib .c you can find some coffee beans you can put your face on it because your face is not a recognized brand you can get your own coffee beans you can begin to sell them on Instagram before you know you're making 101 $15,000 a month you can start to do tours you could start to put posters on your Instagram or in your Instagram stor saying I'm going to do master classes on how to make coffee 20 people only $1,000 each at this premium Barista specialty coffee shop in London the coffee shop will allow you to do it for free because they want people to know get the advertising from you and your brand you'll charge $1,000 each 20 grand for a day to teach people how to pour milk in a cup boom you've got a coffee brand you got an online school you're doing seminars you were a nobody you worked in Starbucks you were a loser you put in a little bit of effort now you drive a Ferrari done by extension anyone who does not drive a Ferrari is a lazy idiot it is that easy to get rich in the world today if you actually try nobody tries instead he'll go to work every day make the coffees go home off some people are so lazy that they will work every day instead of get rich and they think because they're working every day that they're not lazy I'll argue you're exceptionally lazy because you're so lazy that instead of trying and thinking outside of the box you now have to enslave yourself for eternity that's how lazy you are nothing lazier than a man with a nin to-5 because he ain't trying the hole in the ceiling is closing it's closing this won't work forever but it will work everything I just told you about that could work for an electrician could do the same thing teach people how to wire a plug who gives you'll make some money if you try my online school teaches 18 modern wealth creation methods everything I just told you there is not actually inside the school we have 18 other modern wealth grad methods when you join there's a quiz and it says do you have money to invest most people say no do you have time you either have money or time you have one of the two we'll turn your time into money or we'll turn your money into money and you can join $49 a month will teach you absolutely everything we have hundreds of thousands of students but there's hundreds of thousands of people who don't join and they're just destined to lose so you ask how can people make money well let's go deeper down the rabbit hole let's imagine every Barista who watches this now tries my idea the winner is going to be one the person who makes the most beautiful coffee the person who makes the most beautiful videos person who works the longest who tries the hardest who makes the most videos who makes his $9 secrets of coffee book that he sells on Amazon the best book who gives the most value in his master class who gets the best coffee beans for his coffee brand then it comes down to hard work people say work smart not hard disagree work smart and hard because lots of people are working smart if you have five people working smart and the one who works hardest he's going to win I work smart and hard work work hard on the right thing absolutely so there's no avoiding the hard work this idea that you can work smart and not hard I I don't I don't buy that I believe you're going to have to work work hard you have to work on the right thing and work smart first if you don't work smart you're not on the you're not on the starting line working smart puts you on the starting line then you got to work hard to to win the race because there a load of broke people working really hard isn't it absolutely they're not working smart you need both so then for all the Baristas who have watched this who've decided to take that idea which I've given you for free you're welcome the one of you that works hardest is going to be the one that makes the money and then perhaps if you make a bunch of money you can join the war room and then you can come and speak to one of us in person and I'll say how did you get rich you say I watched your interview with Rob MO and I stopped working in Starbucks and so you're welcome you owe me a car Ferrari please 34 are you going to launch ear crypto no I'm never going to launch a crypto I just like to with crypto Twitter because crypto Twitter are full of the biggest degenerate losers on the planet they're losers crypto is the only scenario I can think of where you can make a whole bunch of money while benefiting Society zero even if you do something bad in a normal company let's say you have a company and you you get blood diamonds from Earth that's bad but you do something good you know you you manage to make a woman happy with an engagement ring you manage to make a security contractor Happy by paying him a bunch of money to point the AKs at the children you do something good for someone crypto is unique where somebody can take a $100 and make a million dollars and benefit Society 0% they never help anyone any point and they never learn any lessons along the way if you make money the way you've made money or I've made money you learn how to speak you learn how to deal with stress you learn how to manage people you learn banking you learn taxes you learn things if you make a bunch of money on a crypto pump you have learned nothing you've learned nothing and benefited nobody it is the lazy person's dream to buy a sh coin it blow up then be rich with no work no net benefit to the universe because because the world is cyclical because there's no light without dark because God is just these people always end up going broke because they never learn any skills if I lost everything today I know how to make it all back better and faster than before because of the lessons I learned making it the first time these people know nothing all they know is to gamble so they gamble again lose more borrow money gamble again lose more crypto Twitter is full of degenerate losers and I love to play games with them because they would love for be to launch a coin because they make a bunch of money but the problem is some people would make bunch of money and a bunch of others would lose money there's no such thing as free money for everyone who wins someone else must lose if you buy a coin for a dollar and sell it for $10 someone bought it at $10 if it then goes down the person who bought it at $10 loses money I do not want any of my fans to ever lose money in my name ever because I don't need money so I refuse to sell out my fans for money I am not Logan Paul I will not do that so for that reason I will never launch a crypto sometimes I say I don't know L of crypto and I watch crypto's Twitter go into a degenerate jerk off have a mental breakdown about how much money they can scam from others because they're lazy these are lazy idiot people and they hide behind their little cartoon display pictures and they just want to just scam money they don't want to do any real work I just like to prod them because you know it's funny none of them have my life none of them have my money none of them ever will and the great thing about it is Imagine one of these crypto losers became a billionaire say he bought coin everything went well he became billionaire great we have the same amount of money now cool I can still rip his throw out and he's still a dork and he still can't speak like I can speak and he still can't go through through the things I've been through and he still can't get women the way I can he still can't be respected when he walks down the street the way I am he's still a nobody money won't save you money amplifies if you're a nerd and you get rich you become a mega nerd if you're a g and you become rich you become top g a car is a simplest proof if you see a tech dork pull up on a Lambo and gets out it's skinny little dork you're like super nerd the lambo makes him a bigger nerd you see me get out at 3:00 in the morning you're scared think I'm a drug dealer or a m boss amplifies money will not change who you are it will amplify who you are which means these crypto losers the worst thing that could happen to them is that they actually get rich because then they become Mega losers you need the struggle to become a man only the pain will give you wisdom you only want a crypto pump because you're scared of pain and you're scared of trouble and struggle that's why you want a crypto pump in the first place so when I talk about crypto I'm just poking the autists I'm just poking the idiots you know me just having fun with them and and and I'll be honest I made a bunch of money on crypto I've made a bunch of it's not who I am it's not my personality I find that amazing anyone who's been following me for a very long time has seen some my OG tweets I was in pancake at like 40 cents and that went up to I $50 something I made I don't know 77 million of crypto but imagine that becoming your personality what kind of loser are you to make some money from a internet digital money and then make it your profile picture and change your display name my I'm Andrew Tate I'm a kickboxing world champion I'm Andrew T that's who I am as a man imagine I became bitcoin. e putting a Bitcoin symbol I'm a yeah I'm a Bitcoin maximalist that's you that's your personality that's everything you are are I look at these crypto influencers man there's some of them on YouTube during the Bull Run they were big like influencer crypto influencers Bitcoin there's one guy who yells all the time I don't know where he's from Bitcoin Bitcoin Bitcoin Bitcoin bro you were never ever ever going to have a woman who loves you ever not truly not deep in her heart not ready to die for you not ready to shoot at the cops while you escape you won't I will cuz I'm me all you talk about is the blockchain no nobody cares nobody cares you made a bit of money great fine why is it your personality get a in life crypto T is full of losers such losers I would argue we could line up 10,000 of them here on the street and I would face them all in Mortal Kombat one by one and I guarantee I might be a little bit out of breath when the 10,000th man falls in a lifeless pile on the floor you will understand why I pra crypto Twitter they're nobody's probably with a cigar in your mouth I would a shame power up first [Â __Â ] them nerds and [Â __Â ] the crypto influencers they're the biggest nerds of all biggest nerds I wish I knew their names this one guy always screaming I did a I did a video about nfts as well that was hilarious there are people who spent $5 million on a JPEG row on a JPEG people were trying to get me to invest in nfts and I said no I'm morally against so you'll make money I don't want to make money that way I want to make money with hardship and struggle I'm going to run my University I'm going to have morning meetings with my professors I'm going to hold them accountable for teaching the students how to make millions of dollars I'm have the war room we're going to do events it's going to be hard I'm going to manage everyone and we're going to put together this huge network of people who are genuinely benefiting I do not want to make money from buying a JPEG for a dollar and selling it for $2 I don't give a [Â __Â ] about that I refuse people were saying to me yo you don't understand it's not just a JPEG bro it's on the blockchain bro and you can see on ether scan who owns it bro you are never going to be loved by a woman ever ever ever never will she look at you with desire she'll look at you and go I guess I kind of have to it's been a few months he does pay the rent that's that's the best you can hope for with your internet coins and I'm and this is from someone who's made money with crypto I have never sat you know what I find amazing about crypto when I was making millions and millions of dollars of crypto I never sat there and tried to convince anyone else crypto guys can't help this I'd sit down at a table let's say Bitcoin had just pumped and I made $20 million so I'm what do you think about Bitcoin I go buy it if you want that's it you ask a crypto guy about Bitcoin now I'm talking to someone with over a thousand Bitcoin if someone ask me about Bitcoin now I have over a thousand someone says what do you think about Bitcoin I said you can buy if he wants an investment that's that's the end ask someone with 1.4 Bitcoin about Bitcoin whoa the money is a scamming because the blockchain Nakamoto Satoshi shut the [Â __Â ] up you're broke you're broke you're broke nobody cares buy new shoes your shoes are all dirty tie your shoelaces these losers have so much to say and no money I don't understand why are you trying to convince someone else to buy Bitcoin you have no money go get a job get a job I think I don't know I'm someone with loads of crypto and someone goes what do you think about crypto do what you want because if I tell them to buy and it goes up they won't give me any money and if it goes down they'll cry their eyes out so why am I even talking to this person nothing to do with me you do what you want make your own decisions you're a full-grown man whenever I see a broki where was I I was in I think it was Miami and they had one of these Bitcoin conventions or something crypto things and I was in my blackedout Escalade with my private security with their guns of course and I and I knew it was going on I was like just pull up outside we're driving around Miami we pull up outside and I just sat there for like five minutes watching the people going in Imagine This imagine you're watching this right now and you're and you're a Bitcoin dork and you went to an event in Miami about a year and a half ago you might have only been a few meters away from Top G I might have been watching you you were walking in an hour and I was sitting in that black Escalade looking at the tinted window I just looked at all these people and I just thought and loser loser loser loser loser loser let's go guys losers so that's a no yeah that's a no sorry crypto Twitter you know what the funniest thing is I'm not done with these nerds funniest thing is this the best thing a crypto dor could do if he made money would be invest in himself because he's a nerd with money now right so like look at Zuckerberg he's doing Jiu-Jitsu he's training he's realized that money cannot make up for all his obvious deficiencies so he has to invest in himself the problem is crypto's made the money so easily they're not used to struggle or hardship so they're not even going to be able to invest in themselves if I was a crypto dork and I made money I would message me Andrew Tate and say I'm a loser but I'm super rich I'll pay you a millionar a day to teach me how to speak like you and teach me how to fight and make me train please but they but they haven't even got the self they're not even smart enough to look at themselves in the mirror and realize that's what they should do with the money you know what they'll do with the money buy a buy a car buy a Gucci t-shirt says Gucci Gucci then they'll buy an nft so they can brag to their other nerds I've got the board a 3.2 board bro life then no hire some Bookers sniff some coke then they'll spend it all then they'll try and gamble again losers if they would have invested in themselves at least they become somebody upgrade your character in the video game of life we're living in a simulation upgrade your character become a superhero as the levels of life go on the bosses get harder and harder to beat that's why you have to upgrade your character that's the whole point of it no nerds I will never launch a crypto ever for that reason because I don't want have anything to do with these dorks also another reason I'm not done I'm not stop when you have hundreds of millions of dollars you're not interested in these super huge pumps super huge pumps are for brokies I'm happy to buy Bitcoin and make a 10% return if I put 100 million make a 10% return it's fine why would I take a risk the only reason these people want to turn a $100 into a million is because they're poor which means they have to take the biggest gambles I don't need to gamble Bitcoin eth I'm done gamble this junk so I will never launch a coin I will never sell out my fans we have the real world which will teach you how to make money for real we have the War Room which will give you the masculine Brotherhood you need to resist oppression that is it I don't need to launch anything else so we've talked about cars money watches and assets we've talked about crypto and all of this goes around to me thinking there's one way that trumps all of them that you've made money and it's also how I've made a few hundred million pounds in sales and that is through speaking through your voice your energy your personality that you articulate in such a way that you can move hearts and minds and create a movement and get people to change and pay you for that change I agree with you a transfer of energy from where they were to where they want to go a an inspiring them to see a better future and when people can see a better future in themselves they'll pay the person who can take them there yeah and that's made you maybe that's made you the billionaire yes you're right it has but I would argue that it's struggle that made me a billionaire because it's struggle that taught me the lessons and then I learned to articulate the lessons in a way people can understand so that's the vehicle yeah struggle always been the vehicle for man right if you or the struggled the engine yes you know what's a perfect example if you watch any I've noticed this it's a observation of mine if you watch any superhero movie bad things happen to him then he becomes a superhero every time Batman's parents died he gets to become a superhero so I think that's pretty obvious in the masculine frame bad things have to happen to you for you to become a superhero but then bad things have to happen but that breaks most people and you have to figure out how to turn that into good correct absolutely and that's also why you have to be harden yourself but that's also why you need to see bad things as a blessing because they're the building blocks to make you the man you want to be when when people say to me this bad thing happened to me I say good that's my that's my instant response this girl left me good I lost all my money good what do you mean good good this is your chance to take all of that negative emotion all of those building blocks and turn yourself into a man that prevents these bad things happening to them ever again now of course you have to have the agency to do that you're right if you're going to be broken by it then you're going to fail but bad things are certainly a blessing I believe that's how God teaches I would actually argue that men only learn through pain I think we only learn that way I don't think men know how to learn the easy way I can speak for myself how many times men are men are pretty simple we'll we'll cheat on our girl and almost loser and we'll cheat on our girl and almost lose her and we'll cheat on our girl and almost lose her and we'll cheat on our girl and almost lose her and then we'll cheat on our girl and she'll leave and we'll be like we had our chances we won't take them this is how we are we'll drive that car and almost crash a 100 times it's only after we plow it into a tree that will learn a lesson do you know we have our board meetings and whenever things are going well we never really thres it out we only thres it out when things are not going well that way always always always that's how we are we learn through pain and suffering which is why God gives it to us because God is here to teach us God is like a father and a father teaches you I believe through pain if a dad wants to teach you how to ride a bike he puts you on the bike let you fall off and get hurt puts you back on the bike over and over and over until you can ride the bike God does the same thing you don't get the lessons you want you get the lessons you need you need absolutely agree so I believe that bad things happening to you are a fantastic thing I believe you need to be strong enough to deal with them and then articulate them I do find it amazing that a lot of people can't speak well I find that truly amazing if you don't have the ability to project your thoughts to other people I don't know how you're going to be successful in life the reason I refuse to learn another language is because I haven't learned English yet there's words I don't know and English is the most profitable language for me to know so I'm going to learn English if I want to spend time learning a language I'll read the English dictionary I'm not going to learn another language just to St suffering like a dummy but there are people who've been speaking English their entire life and they can't even speak it it's actually a a pet peeve of mine you know when you said earlier about being rich allows you to say no I'm going to be very honest I am the worst person to pitch to I get people trying to pitch me for business and I'm the worst because if you're a vegan no if you turn up in a Prius or a Tesla no no I'm nothing against Tesla don't ban me Elon but if somebody cannot project their ideas to me succinctly I instantly dis just dislike them because maybe I have ADHD maybe I'm too busy I don't know what it is but I don't have time for your ums and a I don't have time for it so if I'm sitting at a meeting and somebody goes um so uh we're going to start with um and this is how people speak You're a full grown man and you can't finish a sentence without saying um or a in the only language you know you've been speaking it for 40 years it bothers me it's a pet peeve of mine it irks me occasionally we make mistakes fine whatever but if you actually listened to most people speak that's how most people communicate with the world you wonder why you can't convince a girl to sleep with you um uh um your tis are nice um dummy you're a dummy no wonder you can't make any money you're an idiot this is people and a on their way through life it botherers me when people come to pitch me if they say um or a too much in the first sentence it's over like sorry sir when you learn to talk English when you learn to speak I might give you another chance goodbye so you're right the ability to project the thoughts inside of your mind in a way that other people can digest and is also entertaining is massively a superpower how do you develop that superpower it's not through practice people think it's practice practice doesn't make perfect because because you can practice a really bad habit and get really good at a really [Â __Â ] thing absolutely yeah the person who ums and AZ at 48 has been practicing his whole life he's practiced just fine great at he's great feedback is what's important you have to analyze I'll give you an example when I was playing chess as a kid I would play chess for two hours a day training under my father one hour would be play one hour would be going back through the games and analyzing the games I always enjoyed playing but I hated analyzing but it was the analysis that made me better and I can prove that now because when I was eight or nine I think my rating was around 1500 now I've been playing Blitz I play three minute chess online for 20 years ever since I was a child and my rating is700 I've gotten no better in 20 years Years cuz I don't watch my games back I don't analyze them I don't look where I made mistakes I just play that's the problem so when people speak they just speak they don't watch themselves back I'm going to watch this podcast 10 times and I'm G to identify every single time I stuttered or made a mistake or didn't use the word I should have used and then people are going to ask me how do I speak the way I speak why do my podcast get the most views because I'm a professional and I'm not going to do something I'm going to do it properly that's why most people will do a podcast and they'll just sit there and they'll talk [Â __Â ] and then they'll finish it and they'll go on with their broky day and be a broky but it's very interesting what you said about speech because that also ties back to my current predicament this is the first time in my adult life I can't use my superpower because my superpower is talking if you would have put me in front of someone and give me an hour to convince them that I could rip out their throat with my little finger I guarantee by the end they'd be afraid we both know I probably couldn't but by the end part of them would think he's confident I can't talk in court because I don't speak Romanian it's very weird for me I became acutely aware of my superpower because I'm going through this process and my lawyer is talking blah blah and I'm like why am I so frustrated with all of this and one day it dawned on me ah I don't get to talk when I get to talk this is how much of a superpower speaking is when I get to talk it's fine I could have talked the ocean out of freezing me to death on the Titanic I could have literally said listen bro my unmatched perspicacity could have ran my mouth and I would have you know it would have warmed up for me I'm that guy I can't talk now so it's very frustrating so it's interesting you say how it's a superpower it certainly is because I've even realized it in this current predicament I mean how important it is to be able to speak when you've lost it because you've lost it like if you lost your hand yeah that's right exactly because I've lost it and the fact there are people going through the world today who want to be successful and want to have all these amazing things and they only speak English and they communicate in English and they try and get other people to understand their ideas in English and they can't speak English born to loose born to loose on a recent live I did I pissed a [Â __Â ] lot of people off CU I said that ADHD doesn't exist okay do you think ADHD exists as a concept or do you think it's something sold to us by big farmer I don't think it exists I agree with you and I'm going to say there may be some very extreme examples of somebody who may have ADHD but like everything in the world today now it's been so massively overprescribed that has lost all meaning like we talked about rape earlier over accuse loses meaning ADHD is overprescribed lost all meaning along with basically every mental illness it's overprescribed so it means nothing anymore I watched a show Once about a kid I don't think he had ADHD maybe he did or maybe he had autism I don't know what he had something and he had to walk down the stairs in a particular order skip the first step hop on the Second Step turn backwards walk three-steps some weird order for his stairs if he didn't when he got in the car he'd have a temper tantrum and his parents had to take him back in for him to walk the stairs and I remember sitting with a girl there saying this is garbage that kid needs discipline and the woman said to me oh maybe has ADHD maybe has autism you don't understand everything you're not a psychiatrist you're not a therapist blah blah blah I turned to her and said I have never seen an African child who has to walk 10 miles for water doing the walk twice because they missed a step ever if it was a disease that's exactly what you'd see you'd see African kids walking backwards and doing a hop and doing the walk twice cuz they missed the step never seems to happen does it so it's not diseases it it's idiot parents with a spoiled kid and I would argue the ADHD is pretty much the same in most cases oh he doesn't want to listen he has ADHD no you have no control of your child that's the first thing the second thing of course he has ADHD when he's sitting on a tablet playing video games all day and now he has to go to school and read a boring book he's bored as I would be of course he is the only thing that's going to keep him doing something that bores him is discipline and you don't discipline your little kid so no he hasn't got ADHD you're a crap parent how about that I would have loved I would have loved to tell my father I can't play chess cuz I have ADHD I would have loved you got the best see the reaction cuz there were times I didn't want to play chess but I had to play chess but because I understood that there are some forces of nature which you cannot argue against when a hurricane comes there's not much you can do and when your father says to play chess there's not much you can do besides obey unless you want to be destroyed so I understood I would have loved to see his reaction dad I have ADHD teacher says I have ADHD bro I don't know if I'd be sitting here alive but I was raised in a disciplinarian household and I would love for my children to try that crap with me try it I guarantee my kids will not have ADHD I'll say it here on camera I won't I won't allow them to I won't allow them to now I'm like I said I'm sure there's extreme examples but I think most of it is just overdiagnosed lack of discipline like everything else in the world thyroid No overdiagnosed Lack of discipline that's all it is depression No overdiagnose Lack of discipline discipline will fix your thyroid issue because you'll stop shoving cake down your face and discipline will fix your depression because you'll become such a monumentally successful person you're not depressed anymore and it'll fix your ADHD because you do what you're supposed to do not because you want to do it not because you're motivated to do it but because you have to do it so you're going to do it that's how it works that's all it is we lack discipline in the world today and there are certain Nations where they don't lack discipline and for some reason all of these illnesses don't exist if they're an illness why are they not Universal Across The Human Condition why could the kids in China go to school and listen in school but the kids in America can't if it's a disease genuine question to all the psychiatrists who are making a bunch of money and big Pharma who are making a bunch of money someone answer me why can the Chinese kids listen to the teacher and why can't the American kids listen to the teacher if it's a disease that comes out of nowhere I'll tell you why could get your ass whooped in one place and other you won't I remember I love my father with all my heart but I remember his favorite his favorite saying was so brutally simple used to frustrate me when I was young but it was true I don't negotiate with children done can I have this candy no why I don't negotiate with children and if I asked again I got my ass kicked that was it now I'm a full grown man I think yeah I don't negoti imagine me negotiating with a kid top je a child here if you're good if you're good today and you don't make a mess I'll give you some candy I have to do a business deal with a six-year-old I have to do a business deal with a toddler like a dummy if you want to sleep in a house and you want to eat food you're going to do as I say because I raise you and people can come along and call me all these names blah how he does his bad all I'm talking about is the basic discipline that everyone had only 20 years ago we built the pyramids we went to the moon we built New York City and Mumbai and Tokyo and conquered the entire world with discipline we did fine the kids became adults and everything was okay telling a kid it's not in charge of you does not damage the kid this new world thing is that the kid's in charge of the parent well the kid feels and the kid thinks the kid is six I don't give a [Â __Â ] what the kid feels and thing the kid is six I am 37 I am smarter so no and I do not negotiate with children they will obey me blindly and you know what some liberal idiot is going to take this clip and they're going to put it on Twitter and say Andrew's abusive to his kid and and then you'll just get bigger that'll get bigger like a dummy and I cannot wait because the world is cyclical God is just for the day to come when their little loser Offspring with their huge list of mental illnesses is failing in life in 30 years from now and little Andrew tapate is driving his Bugatti one of 10 and his their little loser off spring get to look at my winner Offspring and perhaps if I'm still alive and that liberal idiot is still alive I can inbox him on Twitter and say you failed as a parent told you and I'm pet you enough to do that so I will how many kids you have it's confidential but if the the amount you say is not putting any of them in any risk is it depends what if they want to annihilate my entire bloodline well but the kids you have the harder that is for them correct and if they don't know how many there are it's even harder is it more than five do I answer it's more than five is it more than 10 I can't give you any more information than that I'm afraid yeah well I respect that but I've still got to do my job hey it's fine yeah it's fine but yeah you know because perhaps after they assassinate me they might go for the future saviors of Earth it's like John Connor is that why you're having so many kids cuz the bloodline the tight surname this is an interesting conversation let's let's we might disagree on this one I think it's the masculine imperative to have as many kids as possible and I think the only reason men don't have a bunch of kids with a bunch of women is because they're afraid of their woman getting mad at them and yelling at them I think that men if you were to be honest with yourselves in the mirror you would say I want a bunch of kids with a bunch of beautiful women but they don't because they meet one woman who they love which is fine and they know that they have more than one woman to have kids for they have kids outside of their marriage is going to upset their wife which is fine I'm not hating on them I'm saying that it's not what they want they're allowing the woman's feelings to Trump their biological imperative which again is fine but then you have to sit and think is my bloodline and my biological imperative and my Offspring and my Dynasty less important than the feelings of a crying woman who I pay her bills anyway I don't know is it but in a thousand years your bloodline will be gone or in a million years your bloodline will be gone or in disagree in 100 million years of bloodline will be gone takes will always exist into attorney masters of iida and I will make sure that is true so as a man you have to weigh up you have to sit and say okay I want as many children as possible from beautiful women because I want to recreate as much as possible because that's my masculine imperative however it's going to upset the woman who I love so I'm going to allow her feelings to be more important than my Dynasty I understand why most men make that decision but then you have to sit and say well perhaps if you're in a situation where you're a billionaire and you can financially take care of all these children and all these families and then perhaps if you believe that you're going to raise the children to resist the Matrix and they're going to be future Freedom Fighters perhaps you having as many as possible as even more important perhaps now it's actually imperative that it is more important than the female's feelings even if the woman has a mental breakdown even if she cries her eyes out even she says why do you have kids with all those chicks why is she pregnant again I have to save the world so do you okay so I get that so the the wives and the girlfriends do do they all know this is what you're doing well they're watching this love you no it's it's I'm I'm talking hypothetically no you know I am know I'm saying would I be a man in my heart if I allowed a woman's feelings to try to to Trump my biological incentives and my ability to save Humanity into the future and my Dynasty and my bloodline because one woman whose bills I pay is going to get sad about it what is The Logical decision as a man baby it's okay you're my favorite yeah she has a kid but you're my favorite here's a Bentley you know the problem is this is basically all women's fault because women are slow if men grew babies it would take two weeks 9 months to make a single baby and you're worried about me having them with someone else well if you would go if you get it done if you gave me one a week we'd be fine that's 52 a year that's enough if you're going to tell me that across five years the best I'm going to get is three little babies sounds like a skill issue he you get in to fight Jag Paul Nah come on he would interesting it should have happened three or four years ago when I first called him out but I have other fights going on unfortunately okay so let's say you could get out of Romania and there's a logistical way you could fight Jake Paul would you fight Jake Paul or Logan Paul or Jake and Logan you and Tristan I take Jake and Logan same night you know what it's kind of you must be tempted but then temp tempted for what don't need money I don't need Fame I'm the aside I'm more famous than them I'm more I'm richer than them Jake's actually a nice guy I have nothing against Jake I don't know Logan I spoke to Jake I know this is gonna sound crazy my credentials are based on my physical capability and they exist up till about three or four years ago because I did a video calling out Jake Paul three or four years ago up to about three or four years ago I still walked around on the street by myself and I knew that I could deal with 99% of problems myself but then something changed and I'm not sure what it was I don't know if I'm getting old I don't know what it was but now I I kind of see fighting as below me and I'm glad I did it and it's a huge part of my personality and I'm glad I can still do it make no mistakes I can still do it but now I think I mean now I don't go anywhere without five armed goons I just feel like I don't need to eat my I'm a billionaire now my hands are clean and just shoot it just you know I can't explain something's changed mentally it's like the mafia mentality has changed I've gone from the Hitman to the guy who calls the hits that's how I feel and every time people mention this fight they say you can make $10 million and I just think 10 bro I made that yesterday I didn't get out of bed 10 million to train two of your cars bro it's pennies to me it's not even worth it but I think you can make a lot more than that though yeah of course I could and I'd spark them but I feel like it gives it gives them more credibility than it gives me and yeah but didn't you say earlier you know you like to be able to do what other people can't so wouldn't there just be some pleasure in Itor of course but when you've had 80s something fights I mean it's not like I haven't done there been there done it it's listen it's not completely off the table but as things currently stand with my Matrix attack the fact I'm going to end up back in jail the fact that I want my car collection back I want my money back like this is another I've got three or four years of legal battles to worry about and then by then I'll be what 42 I think just the Divine timing wasn't right if it wasn't for this Matrix attack 100% it would have happened I think I think it would have happened this year but the Matrix attack came and it is what it is but I nothing to against Jake Jake's a really nice guy Logan I don't know Logan he spoke but he's just jealous I'm more relevant than him that's life so Jordan Peterson called you reprehensible oh and only Los wait stop wait wait my heart is broken please only losers love Andrew Tay oh my heart is broken no not Jord not not Jordan peeron never cleaning my room again give a [Â __Â ] who cares you know what I don't watch any you know what I find really great these nerds both conservatives and liberal alike they're all nerds they make videos trying to like take me down I think it's so funny imagine spending four hours editing a video but I don't watch it I'm busy I don't know what they say and I don't care and I don't watch it I have no idea what they say I don't cool the enemy of my enemy is my friend I have nothing against Jordan I'm not emotional about these things I literally I genuinely have nothing against Jordan I could sit and argue with Jordan I could enter the cage and beat the [Â __Â ] out of him or I could shake his hand and be his best friend whatever he wants I don't care what do you want to do friend hi Jordan you want to fight to the death or do you want to speak on the same stage on the same side or do you want to debate or what do you want could I'm not emotional about this like it's no big deal to me could a a good thorough debate between you two be something that would be a I think it would be boring challeng I think it would be boring because I think we agree on most things right I think we agree on everything and I don't think there'd be a debate because we don't actually disagree the only disagreement is that I think and again this is a someone who's watched very little of his work but I see Clips Etc he's very intelligent and speaks from a philosophical thought point of view I think he's very in his mind there's a lot of thinking and I am very action-based and there's a lot of action I feel like if there's a problem his answer will be to think certain ways and my answer will be to do certain things I always believe in action over everything I don't believe in stopping and thinking and reading a book from a psychiatrist and pondering why I decided to girl who go out get chicks boom get to it so I feel like he's far more thought based on Far More Action based perhaps we could argue about the methods towards success for that reason but all in all I think we agree on most things the only thing I've ever genuinely disagreed with him about was his tweet on Israel and Ben Shapiro I don't know how he reaches to keyboard he must have a he's down here somewhere booster seat was typing yeah go to war go to war yeah go to war but uh he's such a nerd both of them both of them were were the things they said about Israel I thought were were reprehensible that's the only time Jordan said anything I truly disagreed with do I think I'm gonna let him off here do I think he's evil no I think he just emotionally reacted to a situation without thinking and I think he understands how it looks and he regrets it and we all make mistakes so I don't hold it against him but I have nothing against Jordan Peterson I think if you listen to Jordan Peterson you're going to be a better person overall he probably dislikes me and I understand why he dislikes me he dislikes me because he thinks oh Andrew is a pimp blah blah you know what's funny we're talk about this whole pimp thing I'm from a luten council estate my neighbor's house got raided for drugs like four times right people around me were stabbed to death the cars in the car park of my school the teachers cars were set on fire most of the people I went to school with are in jail or sold drugs or murdered people I am from the lowest Echelon of society in the UK before that I grew up in Gary Indiana the murder capital of America my mother and father split up I moved to England on my own single mother household raised on the council Su everyone watches top boy everyone watches these shows where people from this socioeconomic background sell drugs everyone gets it it's fine when you're from the bottom you have to find a way out the way I found out the way I found I didn't kill grandmas didn't rob houses didn't break into cars didn't sell drugs didn't do any of the horrible things that everyone does every single day what did I do was Drive traffic to web pages for girls who are already doing only fans and webcam work like a dork like a nerd I found a technical way to drive traffic to web pages and escaped the ghetto without mugging anybody without grabbing anyone up and putting a knife to their throat nothing then these morally pure white picket fenced middleclass conservatives who grew up in a household where there was always food on the table who've never seen struggle sit and say he's a bad person if you're from the streets you'd understand I've done nothing compared to what I could have done and the fact that they attacked me for it shows how detached they are from reality and that is why they'll never have the fan base I have because I can speak to the people at the top and the bottom if you're going to sit there being raised in a happy middle class household with food on the table and two Christian parents who love each other very much getting read little Bedtime Stories and then you want to sit and tell people from the streets they shouldn't ever drive traffic to a website to escape the ghetto then you sound like an idiot dig had to do to get out Jay-Z sold crack to get out now he's a rapper who holds that against him it's worse than driving traffic to a website I would argue nobody they're just jealous of my Monumental success but there's no light without dark the reason I monumentally successful is because I had to go through those times that's why they dislike me that's why Jordan says Andrew is reprehensible I'm just going to tell you I could sit here all day and I think you probably could as well always someone for me to make fun of friend give me a name give me a name nah but um let's do some quick fire sure um okay what shocks you about your rise to infamy I wouldn't say anything shocked me about it that's a very good question am I arrogant to think it was always going to happen and I deserve it not I deserve it because I'm so great but I deserve it because I'm brave enough to help other people I think God gave it to me because I'm here to help other people I genuinely believe God gave it to me so that I could runt pledge.com and feed Starving Children help people to escape the matrix before the hole in the cloud saves dis closes save people from depression by explaining to them that nobody cares I believe I have a purpose I believe that's why it was given to me I think it's interesting now that I feel like Fame has changed I don't feel like there's very many famous people anymore you know in the '90s or the 80s hul Hogan was famous Hulk Hogan he was everywhere yeah Michael Jackson Michael Jackson everywhere I feel like maybe I'm one of the last true superstars on Earth I I look at I think who's as famous as me and I can't think of anyone like you can name a rapper and I guarantee if that rapper walked down the street in Mumbai or Bucharest or Tokyo he'd approached less than me maybe in America he might be known but like global World Fame I can't go anywhere I can't go anywhere without being swarmed anywhere I was in Slovenia when that video was made with the thousands of people around the buetti I can't go anywhere I don't know if anyone's even famous anymore but I feel like I've only got it to try and help people I think that's what I have to do that's why I have to tell the truth I'm not shocked by how I've been attacked for it I guess the true answer is I'm shocked I'm still here I'm shocked they haven't got rid of me yet I am shocked by that if you were to ask me before I was famous how long can you be famous and really tell the truth I would have said cuz I'm a professional I would said how famous the most famous man in the world tell the truth to who to everybody especially the military age males the number one demographic they need to sigh off to die in Army and to work their ass off as the backbone of the slave Force while having no rights I would have said a couple months there's no way they're going to let me they going to let you for years just talk and wake up people's minds once they're awake they ain't going back and they would have said how do you get rid of him I probably would have said will you delete him from everything what if he doesn't get deleted will you put him in jail what if he gets out of jail and then you kill him I'm surprised I'm still here surprised we're filming it's been years now everything's a lie it's all a lie don't believe it everything they tell you is a lie money doesn't work the way they tell you it works school doesn't work the way they tell you it works the things they tell you to do to get rich like get a mortgage and just pay that off after you pay student debts never going to make you rich everything about geopolitics is a lie we don't need to kill all the people in Yemen for no reason it's all a lie it's all an attack on your masculinity it's all a lie they haven't killed me yet how do you show love to who to a girlfriend to my brother to my children how to who to the world to myself yeah I have to say I thought that was a good question it was you're proving that yours was a better one I'm just a professional sir and I like to have specifics to work with yeah sometimes or you do an hour's rant on I can start I start ranting if you like then I'll just go through them all one by one no I didn't think it in that context and I'm going to not not girlfriend's not brother um how do you show love to friends and family I think you show love through no no how do you okay I show love to friends and family by being brutally competent I think a man who is not useful isn't ever going to be loved and I think you have to give love to receive love for me to love someone I want them to love me for them to love me I have to be useful as a man I think men that are not useful are not loved by anybody whether it's their girlfriend or Society or other men if I had a brother and I said to him I need help with this and he said don't know can't tired thing what's the point of you if you if a girl if a wife asked her husband to fix a problem and he goes don't know can't tired she wouldn't love him anymore useless men men who are not useful are not loved as a man you're never truly loved for who you are you're loved for how useful you are and and they'll lie to you about this especially women I'd love you even if you were a useless loser then why aren't you with a useless loser you always seem to be with the winner isn't that funny your love for how useful you are so if I want to show love to my friends and family I want them to love me which means I have to be ultimately useful that's how I show love and is that how you show love to women I yeah I'm the guy people call when they have a problem if you end up with one phone call whether you're kidnapped arrested trapped under Rubble whatever it is and you can call one person you call Andrew T if you have my number if you're fortunate enough you call me I'm the problem solver they love me I'd love people who could fix all my problems if I had a number I could call to get rid of this Matrix attack I'd love that guy too of course I fix everyone's issues if you need $10 million you call me so for that reason I'm loved and the way I can show love to them is always being able to fix their problems if you're a man and you love the people around you you better get as strong and Rich and competent as possible to show it if you're a weak useless man how can you even show love hugs you're weak and useless they don't want your hugs you're slimy if you're a man and you want to show love to people you need to show it through competence I don't know how a man who has no Constitution about him can even show love because that's how love is shown love is shown via protection physical protection which can be helping them make the right decisions which comes from wisdom Finance you show Love by giving them money so they're protected my woman will not have to wait at a bus stop where she could be attacked she'll get picked up by armed guards in a Rolls-Royce all that requires my competence to show love if I was incompetent how could I even show love hold hands hug problem with that is do you hug people of course but the problem is with a hug from a guy without competence isn't scarce it's not rare it's needy well it's more like a needy I want your energy out of you and it's easy to find and it's only the scarcity of something that gives it value if you're a normal dude the biggest problem you have is that your woman's clearly fineing normal dudes means you better watch out when she goes to order a KFC bucket because she's going to order from a normal dude you might give her a smile is cheesy as [Â __Â ] extra little extra little packet of ketchup before you know she's on her back I don't have to worry about that is worry about that because there's no one on my Echelon my woman can we my woman can go through life for the next 20 years interacting with dudes shopping malls whatever whatever and it's just like you're not Andrew you're not Andrew you're not Andrew you're not Andrew you're not there's no one else up here up the top of the mountain so but I show love to her by being that guy so if you're a man and you want to show love to the people around you you need to get up and become important and strong and Rich and if you don't have the motivation to do that then you don't even love the people around you you don't love yourself or anyone else that's how I show love I show love to the people who I care about by always being the person who can help them when they need which means I need to get up and train I need to get up and work I need to make a bunch more money more connections more important friends more houses more everything that's how you show love as a man I don't see how useless men even show love I can't I can't think of a way now as a thought experiment if I was a useless man how would I show love and there's no possible way because you can flutter with messages that's what useless men usually do flutter with messages flutter with time but your time has no value so it doesn't matter if I give you a 10 million useless pesos they're useless this is what a lot of men don't understand it's kind of interesting when you become Ultra important your time is Super valuable so my time is I know England hates me but you know what the British pound sterling is still the best looking money my time is the British pound sterling one pound if I give her hour a month it has value but if you're Zimbabwe in dollars or whatever they had Zimbabwe in pounds I think it pounds your currency is completely valous you can give her a million hours it doesn't mean anything because you're not important this is what unimportant men don't understand they're like I text you all the time I send you flowers I message you I hug you I flood your phone I tell you how much I love you and you just left me for that guy he doesn't even reply because his one reply is worth a million hours of your replies because you're a nobody so even your attention has no value when you're useless and you have nothing else to give so what can how can you show love as a man if you don't have competence I can't even think of how you can show it that would be actually a terrible existence to love people and not be able to show it but if you truly love them you wouldn't stay useless and maybe you don't love anyone maybe you're just an empty shell for the Matrix maybe you're a slave part of the AI machine time to get get your QR code stamped on your forehead interesting if you love anybody or anything you're going to become important even if you love your town you'll learn to fight you love your city you'll join your army whatever love is the B love is the driver for all masculine achievement and competence love so I'm a man full of love by extension my brutal competence is nothing other than proof of how love filled I am what's a story you've never told or a secret you've never shared I got robbed in Moscow don't think I've ever told this story have I ever told this one let me think don't think so I got robbed in Moscow so when was it what happened and I like Russia and I like Russians but it's the first time I went to Moscow three years ago four years ago so do I tell this story yeah all right everything starts with women doesn't it man there's such an attack vctor so I'm talking to this chick on Instagram blah blah blah I'm ignoring her she keeps messing me all the time come Russia come Russia come Russia I'm like no I'm not coming to Russia I've got things to do then like seven other baddies from Russia start messaging me and everyone wants me to go to Russia like why do all these hot girls want me to go to Russia why everyone wants me to go to Russia this sounds like a setup something right but I'm glad I can't go to Russia I can't get Visa anyway it's too much work then the football game came there was some football thing I think it was a FIFA I don't know football Euro game something it was in Moscow and if you bought a ticket you instantly got a Visa to go to Russia so I was like this is the easiest visas ever going to be do I go and then I looked up and I found a game I think it was like Poland versus Korea or something it was like six EUR this ticket to this game it's like a six Euro Russian visa with no work okay but I'm GNA be on my game because I don't trust this they're after me the agents so I buy this ticket I get my Visa I fly to Moscow I booked the kinsky Advance the kinsky hotel because I think if i s a festar hotel I'll be okay I land at the airport I've got my bag I go to walk out guy in a yellow vest goes taxi taxi I like y taxi I go to get in taxi and he starts walking towards the civilian car park and this has happened to me a lot of times in Eastern Europe it happened to me in mdova even in Romania happens sometimes people pretend to be taxis but they're not taxis and they try to get to their car I'm like no no I want an official taxi not get in your car I have a taxi I was like no no no no been around goodbye turned around start walking back to the taxis him and his yest runs up and goes okay okay okay and he points at this yellow car that said taxi in the taxi rank taxi and he goes says something to him in Russian blah blah blah blah and he goes okay here taxi sir taxi guy gets out the taxi driver taxi driver gets out he's like six foot 130 kilo Mongolian look like a wrestler gets out Zang yeah Zang Zang GLE Gets Out and because this is how my mind works I look at him up and down and go could I take him be messy I'll be all right but it'd be messy so he gets out he opens the trunk ushers for me to put my bag in the trunk put my bag in the trunk close the trunk get in the back of the car car starts driving down the right way in Russia and he has his phone as the meter which is the first suspicious thing and his phone is up there and this and this this number Russian rubles is going through the [Â __Â ] roof I'm like how much is the Russian Ruble I don't even know so I get my phone out and I turn on the data and I get my text message hi data is 25 pounds a megabyte and cool whatever how much is the Russian Ruble and I worked out I've been in this car for 4 minutes and I owe $600 in taxi so there's no way that's the taxi fair so we're driving down the highway at speed and I'm like brother this is fake this this is a scam bro and this is the weirdest experience of my life I've he totally ignored me but what can you do he's driving the car and people don't ignore me when I talk so this big man's driving the car and I've tapped him on the shoulder saying you're trying to rob me I like bro you're trying to rob me stop the car and he's just like just totally ignoring me driving the car so I'm like what I don't want to hit him but I guess I kind of had to so I shoved him so the car moved a bit and said stop the [Â __Â ] car I'm not paying this I don't have the money I don't have the money bro I've been around long enough I know a killer when I see one and he turned around and looked me dead in the eye this man's killed someone I swear to God cuz I have that look so I know when I see see it takes one to no one he looks me dead in the eye looks back gets the phone dials a number hands me the phone because he guess he doesn't speak English had the phone say hello it's the first guy who tried to take me to the car he goes you wanted a taxi I was like bro I don't even have this money on me so I don't know what you expect to happen cuz I don't have this money on me goes you want a taxi pay the fair I said bro I can't pay it I don't have it tell him the stop at the nearest gas station I'll give him the money I have on me and I'll get a real taxi hold up didn't even answer me just hung up with me so like what can I do here if I hit this guy I guess the car crashes this other guy isn't answering they want money I no longer have so I tapped the guy and I said okay okay okay I'll pay it call your friend again call your friend get me the phone again I was like listen I had like I think I had like $4,000 on me I said look I have $500 is all I have I'll pay the $500 when we get to the end if you let me out go goes no you paid the meter hung up again like you fing you unbelievable so I thought it would be smart so I emailed because my phone call wasn't working so I emailed the kinsky and said I'm having a problem with the taxi can someone be waiting for me outside the kinsky hotel it's urgent please as a I emailed their info@ kinsky Russia as a complete random and I thought they'd never reply in time they replied instantly the 20 seconds yes sir someone be waiting you no problem so I like ah thank God they replied to that that's great the concierge can argue the taxi drive work all this out so now I'm just relaxing I'm kind of chill a bit and I just had to PR the guy I was like do you speak English then totally I was like you're friendly so I'm just talking so anyway we pull up at the hotel I'm all confident right guys's gonna be outside I pull up at the hotel nobody's outside nobody no no con nothing so said to the guy I go to get out the car I get out the car the guy then gets out the car comes and he stands face to face with me like a boxing stare off and shows me the phone of how much I owe him must by now must I don't even know what is in R $3,000 American dollar something ridiculous I said bro I don't have it he looks at me like he's going to murder me I don't have it I said I have $500 that's all I have he goes okay using my ninja fingers my hands I reached on my pocket and I ninja off like 500s cuz I got a pile of money like this so I'm like I give it to him and then the takes the money go and I'm I'm standing at the back of the car waiting for him to open the trunk gets in the car and starts driving down the road I'm like bro bro my bag my bag my bag he stops like 5 me later and goes the rest of the money he knew they set me up when I put my bag in the trunk at the beginning and my bag's got my laptop my all my clothes everything which is worth thousands and thousands of dollars now if you ever get in a taxi you don't put your bag in the boot was a setup I was like you [Â __Â ] I like call your friend so he calls a friend I said listen I've already given him $500 it's very clever what you did with the bag like the guy from the kinsky is about to come out now I can't give you more than this we have to come up to something sensible said I can go to a cash point and try and get some more money but I need my bag and he goes okay 500 more I said fine I not the phone instantly peeled off 500 didn't bother going to a cash point and then guy gets back out the car and me and him have a Mexican standoff at the back of the car he opens up the boot go he he grabs my bag I've got the money we kind of swap them just after we've done that after I paid this [Â __Â ] $1,000 the guy from the kinsky walks out oh Mr T you need any help like yeah help yeah carry my bag you're useless it's been 10 minutes where have you been well sorry Mr T useless it's kind of funny because for the my other four days in Moscow I had a great time I love the Russian people they're very nice I guess I was unlucky but every time I left the hotel there was like a row of taxis and they all looked like this guy and they'd all stare at me and I thought I'm so glad I paid him because I guarantee if I got in a fight with that guy I'd be dead by now they're just waiting outside the kinsky these dudes and the lesson is never put your bag in the back of a taxi that's the lesson for everybody and that's the story and I survived and I had a great time in Moscow but I'm not going to lie it did sour things a little bit for me I was a bit nervous on edge and that's how I paid $1,000 for a taxi turns out the official rate which I found out on the way back to the airport which was booked from the hotel I think it was like six bucks you go I got wrecked but to lose my bag and my luggage was worth so much more well and surely the $1,000 the lesson was worth more than $1,000 yeah I mean I like to look in the eyes of killers there's not many people like that around anymore in the west so you kind of enjoyed it in a way I mean Russia's Russia in the west you don't see that look very often but um it was a stark reminder of the realities of this world because the realities of the world always boiled out to violence and I understand that very well and sometimes you get a little bit comfortable there are people who walk around through Earth they're walking around we're looking I can look outside right now there's people walking around and they don't understand that every single thing they rely on and everything they love is backed by violence it always has been it always will be the whole underpinning of a civilized society is violence the only reason we don't need violence is because there is a threat of violence and you can nail it down to any law and regulation as simple as a parking ticket if you don't pay your parking ticket they will give you a fine and if you don't pay the fine they will take you to court if you don't go to court they will take your house and if you don't give them your house police will come kick sh you throw you in jail it ends in violence in all things and it was a good reminder to understand that making a mistake putting my bag in the back of a car in a in the boot as opposed to keeping it on me brought me this close to a physical confrontation with probably a Mongolian wrestling champion in the middle of a street in Moscow by myself and it's a good reminder that violence is always so close it's only a few steps away at all times and and and the reminder that if you have enough money you can buy yourself out of death well yeah cuz if you hadn't had a th 5,000 or been rich I would have been in a lot of trouble you could have been dead I think so and it was good also to to see that I felt nerves but they were the same nerves I felt before I fall I didn't feel fear which was a good reminder as well to know that I'm still not afraid I get I get nerves because the nerves sharpen me but I don't feel fear which was a good thing but uh I still remember his eyes you I don't think I've ever been looked at like that in the west and that's another thing that we can tie back into our whole conversation we just had about how certain societies still operate in a certain way and our Western societies are so failed maybe I should have told him about LGBT and feminism he might have let me go maybe I should have said this is this is bad this is misogynist maybe I should just talk some garbage and he would have let me off or is the brutal reality of the world men who are prepared to die for an idea and his idea was I owed him $6,000 and he was ready to KCK sh out me for it and that's the bottom line of all ideas which we can also tie back into what's very interesting all these ideals which are against men are defended by men think about it if feminists go to a feminist rally and anyone tries to interrupt that rally who comes to to stop you men police men defend the idea which is designed to destroy them do you remember when America left the Taliban the America sorry America left Afghanistan and the Taliban took over like a day I was having a debate with some feminist and she was talking about how terrible Afghanistan is going to be because the women can't go to school anymore and women need to go to school because they're equal to men and blah blah blah and I saying yeah well I think women should go to school I'm not saying women shouldn't go to school but I'll argue that in certain Realms women are not equal to men she goes why so well you just proved it the American Army left the afghanistani Defense Force the ADF was left def to defend the girls schools the Taliban started coming imagine that you've been hired into the ADF you get paid $225 a month get given a gun you're some guy guard this girl school girls really need to go to school fine stand there America abandon you you no longer have air support you no longer have night vision they're gone Taliban are gearing up you see the dust of the Humvees in the distance the pickup trucks and they're coming you're standing there like do I want to defend this girl's school and they bounced fair enough so I said to her why don't the women defend the school no why should the women do it you just tell me you're equal to men well no not that oh so so the men have to die so you can go to school feminist I mean I'm just trying to understand I'm not attacking your ideals I'm understanding you believe women are equal to men until it comes to defending an idea then men have to defend your idea which means men are the only ones who allow you to have the idea in the first place because if we don't defend it it doesn't exist which means we own feminism it's ours thanks so much for strong and independent it's men's it's all ours so in the reality of the world all this garbage Falls away anyway because the reality of the world is if you're not prepared to die to defend an idea you don't have an idea you're not allow one that's the bottom line and that's what's so scary about all these ideals which are designed to attack masculinity is that the last masculine men which exist defend it last question sure is happiness the purpose of life and if it isn't what is okay the purpose of life from a boring answer is to procreate as much as possible I believe a man have as many children as possible to further expand I do not believe happiness is the importance is the purpose of life for a man I believe happiness is what children should strive for and I believe women should aim to be happy I believe happiness is for women and children I believe men should have a sense of purpose I believe we should live for something if you live for happiness then you're hedonistic you go to festivals you do drugs you drink alcohol you're an idiot living for happiness as a man makes you an idiot 99% of the time if you live for happiness as a woman you probably want to have a good relationship with your spouse and you want to be Giddy and you want to laugh and joke and raise your children and make pretty things and it's it's pretty good but male happiness is is just being an idiot I think you need a sense of purpose as a man I think you need to have something to live and to die for if you feel purposeful you'll never feel feel sad you may be stressed and you may be busy but you'll never feel sad and I think your purpose can make you happy but I don't think men should be chasing happiness they should be chasing purpose I wouldn't describe myself as a happy person I don't wake up and go yeah I'm not two I'm I mean my my chick's happy yay Italy yay private jet wow this pastor's great yay Ferrari I'm just kind of like yes give me the food I'm hungry whatever she's happy that's her job that's why she's around me she's to happiness women bring the Vibes men bring the money she's happy good I want her to be happy I would hate to be with a miserable woman but I think men being happy is kind of infantile maybe I'm I would hate to be with a miserable woman but I would like to actually ask women would you want to be with a happy man I think women love me because of my competence and because of what I can do but imagine being with a happy man imag I don't know I'm just speaking you're a woman and your man is happy I love coffee this is great have you ever this WOW doesn't gay mean happy I don't know I'm just talking I don't think I'm supposed to be happy I have things to do important things stressful things I have things to do I'm supposed to be competent and purposeful and I'm supposed to attack the Matrix and tell the truth and know iido and make murderers apologize to me in jail and survive the Mongolian wrestler who wanted to kill me and I'm supposed to do all of that I don't know at what point I'm supposed to be smiling like a child my children are supposed to be happy the women around me are supposed to be happy but that's not my job or my purpose I think the men who want to be happy are losers and I think if I think that would actually be a turnoff for most women I think if you were to if a if a man were to say to a woman I just want to be happy and don't want to have any stress you know I just want to be happy I think a woman deep in her heart be like what what do you mean to be happy pay my bills I don't think she wants that either so if your base purpose is to recreate and being happy I'm not saying be miserable at all I think people understand what I'm saying here and being happy for the sake of Happiness itself repels females then I don't think happiness is the purpose of life as a man no you're supposed to be important was gask Khan happy you wouldn't have thought so well I wouldn't I wouldn't describe him as happy he'd be described as a lot of things before happy you'd say he's competent You' say he's successful you'd say he's ruthless you'd say he's smart you'd say he was a tactical genius you'd say lots of things before you ever got to happy if you ever got there do we remember the happy men of history what and plus I mean p if you're purposeful it's lasting happiness is fleeting that's the problem which means you're always going to be chasing a higher high you'll be happy and then it will go away then you want to be happy again then it'll go away you're going to end up just doing dumb sh how you become a drug addict I took a little bit of drugs made me happy and now it doesn't work so I going to take more drugs and this time I'll be happy chasing happiness is is a spiral to nowhere I will argue that my largest transformative periods of my life the times when I've done the most amazing things are not when I was happy was when I was the complete opposite if you were to tell me how do you completely transform your life I'd say end up depressed when you're depressed you can transform your life that's when your soul is Mal Val able enough for you to do whatever it requires to go through the pain that's when you can look a guy in the face and say shoot me then I don't care that's when you're dangerous that's when you get things done that's when you get rich that's when you become a man that's when you train that's why I miss my nightmares now I sleep I'm mad at myself I'm disappointed in me I'm like what no slept four hours no wake up and sweating and panicking that's what I should be doing I don't want to be happy what do I want to be happy for I want to grab Life by the throat and squeeze it I want the Matrix to lock me up again do it I don't care it's kind of like you know I I've always liked people who are very competent but depressed I've known some people who are like depressed and miserable but they're very competent and I like them because if I hired a happy person he's only one bad event away from becoming useless like this guy's already at the bottom bro and he's getting everything done you can't hurt this guy he has nothing to lose I like him give me more of this guy like hey bro your car just got stolen yeah probably those are the best I love those guys maybe I put on a happy veneer but I'm kind of one of them I I expect any minute for police to bust in here and drag me way like told you D to do who cares happy people are oh I'm sad I I don't know I don't think men should be operating in this Paradigm another way I can answer the question is I think happiness there's a really interesting uh documentary about colors and it was about an African tribe and it was talking about how colors affect language so in your book this is red and this is blue because we've labeled them as such and they showed this African tribe that had different names for very different shades of green and to them they were clearly different colors but to us they're just green but this tribe couldn't tell the difference between red and blue because to them it was the same color so they couldn't see the difference in the Colors by how the language determined how your eyes can detect colors it was very interesting and I think the same can be for happy if you set the idea of happy as laughing like a child in Gish immaturity then you're only going to be happy a couple of times a month truthfully if you're an adult but if you set the bar of happy as anything over distraught then you're always happy when you feel true pain in life if your parent were to die your instant reaction is silence when someone's really hurt they don't talk when you're really depressed you don't talk my first day in jail I didn't speak you don't talk when bad things happen if you got a phone call and someone said your all your family just died in a car crash you'd freeze you don't talk so if you set your mind to say if I am speaking I am happy because I'm clearly not distraught then I'm a happy person most of the time I'm happy 99.9% of the time now because I have decided what happy is but if you decide I'm Only Happy When I'm laughing like a child and I have no stress at all and nothing's going wrong and I'm at a festival and my girlfriend's love loves me and well then you're then you're never going to reach it and then you're going to destroy your life trying to reach it so happiness is also self-prescribed so I think if you're a man and your arms are functioning and you can speak today because nothing terrible has happened then you should be happy and don't worry don't worry guys bad things are going to happen they're going to come you have nothing to worry about there will be a day you wake up and somebody you love has died and you can be sad that day why waste a perfectly good day being sad when sad days are guaranteed to come everyone you love is going to die everyone don't worry about it sad days are coming for you so I wouldn't have them in advance if I you I'd wait for a real reason and just smile something a dip that's what I would say and this show is called disruptors what does that word mean to you people who break the Paradigm Who attack the Matrix who disrupt the normal flow of the programming which is designed to be installed in all of us and I think as much as I understand and say about how people need to break free I understand that there has to be Matrix minded people not everybody can break free because Society wouldn't work we need the people who believe in the garbage and we need the people who follow the programming and we need people who lose so that Winners can win there's no light without dark but anybody with a brain is capable of having anything they want in life I believe the universe is very giving and perhaps you will know but I've never met anyone who genuinely tried their hardest for anything and never got it I've never seen somebody dedicate themselves proper L and never and not get it I've never seen it I've never seen somebody try their best and not get it I've seen people pretend to try their best and don't get it I've seen people say they want it and not get it I've seen people make excuses for why they'll never have it and not get it but I've never seen anybody who just wakes up shuts up works and not get it ever you can have anything you want and that's how you disrupt The Matrix because most people are lazy and stupid so just to tie back into my school when I explain to people for $49 I'll tell you exactly what to do and all you have to do is follow instructions sit there and follow instructions and you will have everything you've ever desired the car you want the woman you want the house you want the holidays you want all you have to do is do the work and you can disrupt The Matrix or you can stay lazy you can stay inside the slave programming and people there'll be people who always do that and we need them because uh I don't you don't wash your own cars do you I know so uh someone's going to do it and uh that's how Society functions there's always going to be winners and there's always going to be losers this has been a pleasure thank you Andre thank you thank you very much let me know your favorite
