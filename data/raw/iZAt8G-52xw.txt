I'm still scared of my dad now and he's been dead for 9 years. There have been times in my life, especially as a younger man, where I was at a party and everyone's doing lines of interesting line of not only do I not want one and I would never try one. The first thing that came into my head was my dad will kick my ass. He he'd already been dead for 5 years at that
