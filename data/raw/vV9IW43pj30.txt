what do you say to young men who come to you for advice I say them both beautiful and the most terrifying thing about being a manager born without value Society doesn't care about you you're only going to be cared about based on how useful you are you have the chance to build yourself up and become a superhero if you're prepared to do the hard work and be indefatigable enough never quit but if you're gonna stand around and wait for a handout nobody's going to ever respect you and if your duty is a man to stand up and say I want to be as important I'm strong and good-hearted and God-fearing as possible and I need to work hard to achieve those things
