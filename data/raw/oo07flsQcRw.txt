any man who's had an easy life is going to fall and collapse in the face of adversity and the whole point of being a man the whole point of masculinity is the ability to resist that is the whole point so yeah you're right that's not a sad story that's a very very happy story for us we laugh about it so as as for why our father the chess master oh dad oh we weren't really poor because dad was a chess master i said our guy was a [ __ ] g g but chess pays zero now we have a list of the top 10 richest chess players in the world right now let me get yeah richardson can you get that up yeah top 10 reaches first player so we have one hikaru nakamuru he's like number two in the world i think 50 mil fabiano caruana he played carlson last year in the world champions 13 mil carlson they said he has eight mil caspar all five mill judith polgar of course i had to throw her in yeah hungary trimester tie more red above whatever five mil point is and then it goes down so number number ten the world has two million so these are the top ten richest players of all time and the 10th richest player of all time has 2 million american dollars now this house that we're in is bought and paid for this costs 3 million we have a car that costs 5 million if we were chess players with our net worth we'd be the richest chess players in the world right now our dad was the [ __ ] man and he taught us everything i needed to know about being a man but he never had any [ __ ] money he wasn't even in the top 100 players he never crossed into the top 100 back in 1998 1999 that was his heyday he lived in a car for a lot of his life there is no money in chess there is very little glory in chess which is sad because everyone loves [ __ ] football and soccer and all these sports i don't respect the chess you have to be an intellectual titan to even come close to mastering that game and dad was the man but he never had a [ __ ] penny and you know what this is one of the accusations that if you say it to my face i'll straight knock you out because what you're doing is you're talking about my father's life there's a book called triple x glam written by dr daim shabazz look it up it is a book a biography about the life of my father that was written just after he died if you have any doubts about my upbringing my dad's financial situation you think i'm a trust fund kid pick up that book because a lot of it is about his financial struggles and he never had a [ __ ] penny and if you say something about my father or his life or my life as a child that you don't know to my face you're going to be serving knuckle sandwich so don't talk [ __ ] about but about the dead it's on top yeah it's on site don't don't talk ill or the dead now you could say anything you want about my father if it's true saying he's a millionaire is to discredit the achievements of his sons and if he were alive he kicked your ass so i have to do it for him correct we have to for the bloodline we gotta whoop your ass cause that's what he'd do dad our mother and father got divorced dad stayed in america to play chess we moved to loot in england lived in a council house governor homeless shelter first for two years homeless shelter along with all the kosovans at the time there was a costly crisis here with the cosmans then we moved into a home into a council house mother was on the dole she ended up getting a job as a dinner lady one time that was it we were raised on 300 a month our father was a professional chess player driving from chess tournament to chess tournament in a pontiac sunbird sometimes he won sometimes he lost a lot of time he slept in the car had a couple thousand here maybe but then he had to play chess with it for the next three or four months driving across america from california to new york and it busted out pontiac sun bird playing chess and winning games i i've been with my dad when he would go to the park with no no food no money for food and go to the park and have to hustle the chess park players for [ __ ] fifty dollars and he'd do it and he'd do it because he was a g and he was not afraid of [ __ ] and i put lots of stories on my channel tate speaks about him and how the time he got jumped in detroit and the way he spoke and how hard he was and how he was genius and hard to kill etcetera very much like myself but he never had he never had any [ __ ] money no money because he wasn't interested in money he wanted to play chess as long as he had gas and food that's all he cared about he was a nomadic warrior spartan old school so the idea that we come from money absolute and utter fast it's offensive okay
