They won't respect the grind they can't see. But that's your advantage. Real beasts move in silence. No noise, no validation, just execution. While they sleep, you're working. While they talk, you're building. You don't need to bark when you're becoming the wolf. You don't chase attention. You earn respect. So stay quiet. Stay locked in. Hustle and silence. Rise in power.
