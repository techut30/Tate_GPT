i think you could also argue that boxing is a dance too uh it's a bit different than a tick-tock but i mean you are still on display and you're i mean correct but my life is on the line yeah i was going to say i usually don't have like the threat of my nose being broken when i'm doing a tick-tock dance yeah no forget the nose being broken i've seen five people die i don't wanna i don't wanna sit here and brag and talk about the things i've done to people there are people who will never be the same again after they stepped in the ring with me ever again i've had i've seen screaming wives crying over their their lifeless husband i i've done things you you wouldn't believe when you step in that ring it's a different level it's not a tick tock dance it's actually extremely disrespectful i know you didn't mean to disrespect but it's extremely disrespectful to even insinuate that it's not a tick tock dance it's life and death it's gladiators it's a different completely different realm
