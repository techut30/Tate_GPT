there's a whole bunch of people out here who are effectively slaves and when you're you're a slave if you have a job in any form effectively some slaves are better paid than others but most people are slaves in the days of slavery what would happen is the slave masters would use control and aggression and influence to convince you to do work for free so what they could do is they could get work out of you with something that they can generate from the sky right they can be aggressive from the sky influence from the sky a couple bullets are cheap whatever it took and they could get your labor now we have the exact same thing but they just use Fiat they use Fiat money if the people in charge of the world can print unlimited amounts of said things and you'll give up your life for certain amounts of setting then they own you they control you all you need is hundred dollars to do this print off you go slave it doesn't matter it's not real so who cares so the entire world's a slavery system to some degree maybe you can make enough of those dollars and buy your freedom as I have right but in general it's a slave system and anyone who's out here who still believes because it seems to be there are some people who still believe in like saving up and save my money and if I'm really diligent I get mortgage in 28 years I might own the problem man it's a trap all of it is a trap have you ever met a rich person asked them why how they got rich and they said saving no no this is the biggest flaws I watch so hard and I stay and I saved it like didn't have that morning coffee yeah yeah complete lie and everything they teach you about financial literacy is a lie everything they teach about wealth Creations a lie everything in the future about what you're supposed to do with your money and how you're supposed to think of the lie to get your ass in debt the very very beginning how did you realize all this how did you realize all this so I was my father was a chest ground master I was a chess player so at the age of five I was Indian MSA chess champion and when I was eight I was on my way to become a fetty master so I was one of those child chess Geniuses I never actually ended up becoming a chess master because we moved to England my father stayed in America blah blah blah but I've always been good at pretty pretty good at analyzing the chess board and even from a very very young age I just understood and I don't know exactly where I bought it from I understood the world is a scam all of it I was walking to school one day walking to college sixth form with my four friends in a Ferrari went past I was like yeah I was like bro how do we get one of them what have you done doesn't it bother you he has 400 grand for a car doesn't that anger you that he has 400 G's for a car and our parents are broke on a capsule state they're like oh my goodness that's the average man like the average man has no fire inside of him I'm 16. I couldn't sleep for three days I saw how are you I said I want one now I have four no but this is the exact point right so I always had the fire inside of me what happened is growing up a looting especially all those Asian boys who are driving these fast cars when you go to petrol station three in the morning in a landlord or whatever you pull up you know you don't look at them and go oh he works hard in school no no way no exactly so you know so I always had an intrinsic understanding that the only way to truly get rich is to break the system on some degree so when I was going to school and the school was trying to report the system they're trying to uh convince me that the system is the best way to have a successful life I'll sit here going and everyone's living life I'm strong but it's just I don't believe in any of this
