I'm sure when they finally point a gun to my head I'm going to be a bit nervous but all in all it is what it is Andrew and Tristan Kate were arrested by Romanian police and detained for 24 hours a controversial social media influencer and rwat no we're very innocent men and in time everybody's going to see that and we're very excited to finish this judicial process in our next and we all live

President Biden you're certainly trying to get me killed what are your thoughts on the upcoming election President Donald Trump Putin nailed it The Last Hope for the West if president Tate was in office crazy that sounds I think the world will be a dramatically different place in 20 years you getting thrown in jail I was put in the same cell as Tristan we were put together so they could bug the cell I had prepared for it the best I could I wasn't ready for the level of Matrix attack I was subject to making money is very important when you fight a war recurring Revenue hundreds of

Tate hey guys welcome to this episode of the passionate you podcast it's your host Omar and today we have the privilege in Romania to sit down with none other than the man the myth the legend himself Andrew Tate thanks so much for being on the show today Andrew good to meet you sir oh man I appreciate you uh hosting us here in Romania and uh having us come to you beautiful country and excited to uh get into this today yeah I want to show you guys around it's Romania has got a very bad reputation internationally in general and also because of what they've done to me but to be fair to the place is actually a very nice place it's a very nice country it's safe by all the metrics you can measure a society by it's pretty good except for corruption but then you know we've just started the podcast so I don't want to start off too strong and start screaming at the camera that America's the most corrupt Nation on Earth and so I'm going to calm down a little bit but yeah it's a good place well speaking of America we actually know that you're a big fan of AirHeads so you actually brought you some from the states thank you very much and I wanted to ask you why AirHeads you know I've always love these as a child and then when I left America I was I think I was 11 or 10 I missed them they didn't exist in England and I never really had them since and now I keep getting given AirHeads I'm going to end up fat my entire uh my physique which I've worked on my whole life was going to be disappeared because they're so addictive MH it's kind of interesting you just said uh I know you're a fan of AirHeads I know this is going to get me in a lot of trouble I'm I going to say anyway that reminded me instantly it made me think of a bunch of jokes about bimbo women I know and I thought thinking what do I do I say then my brain was running quickly you said I know you're a fan of AirHeads and I thought about 30 jokes going jail that put me in jail that put me in jail that put me me just take the candy before we get into it you know we'll talk about a lot of what's going on obviously you know not just what you've been going through with the Matrix but before we get into that for people who may have not heard the origin story talk to me a little about where you grew up I know you grew up in Washington DC but talk to me about young Andrew before you became literally the most viral person on Earth talk to me what what was young Andrew where did he grow up and where did the formation for this ambition really begin for you as a kid yeah that's a good question I I was born in DC and then we moved to Indiana we lived just outside of Gary Indiana MH and my father was a professional chess player and I understood I had to work hard and I had to D you to my last name and from as young as I can remember I was told no you have to be exceptional because your last name is Tate it was very clear to me it was never any other type of life that was laid out for me I never expected to have any other easy life or never expected to have a normal life mhm my mother and father broke up when I was 10 we moved to England how did that affect you yeah I think that's probably one of the reasons if I had to self-analyze when I move from America to England obviously you start all over again you go to a new school you have to make new friends and back then I don't know how long ago that was 20 something years whatever if you're American in England it was slightly more unusual and the kids would make fun of your accent or whatever and you have to learn to stick up for yourself you have to learn to fight and to be brave Brave and if I had to be a psychotherapist if I believed in these things and had to analyze my past as to why I am the way I am I think the fact that at a fairly young age I was ostracized and forced to defend myself and forced to stick up for myself and was happy to have a different point of view because I knew nobody could pick on me that probably has something to do with the reason I am the person I am if I had to analyze it so uh you got me thinking now maybe that's a good thing maybe I need to take all my kids and pl and just drag them out of school and drop him in Mongolia somewhere yeah and uh see how that did it did it was it something like a series of events cuz I can relate to that where you feel like an outcast you don't quite feel at home here you don't quite feel at home with this group so it teaches you to kind of stick up for yourself and fight for yourself I think it was just my brother and I we turned up everyone said haha you're weird American kids we said yeah we are say something to our face and they wouldn't and that was it and it just became us too against the world against the world and Chang yeah not much has changed and I think that's the way it's supposed to be it's very it's very interesting when you understand the the brutal dynamics of humanity and also the brutal dynamics of opinions in general but unless you're prepared to defend your opinion usually physically especially outside of the internet world you don't have an opinion at all if you can't defend your ideas if someone comes to you and says I disagree with you and you're afraid of that person well then you're not going to have any ideas different than what the Matrix wants you to hold it takes a lot of Bravery to stand up and say I don't care I know I'm right despite the fact that the whole group or Society or the consensus is saying this because you're going to pay for that at some point I know we live in a world now where physical confrontation and physical violence alone is not enough but I still think it's intrinsic inide of The Human Condition when you know that you are capable in that realm you're more likely to stand up against a system but you can't have an opinion if you don't defend it if you can't defend it if a guy comes up to you and says 2 plus two is five and he can beat the [ __ ] out you m i mean maybe you'll end up a bloody pulp or maybe you'll give up sooner but sooner or later two 2 plus two is going to equal five that's the reality of the world so if you don't stand for something you'll fall for anything yeah absolutely absolutely yeah so I I think just to talk about the childhood thing I understood from a young age I had to stick up for myself and defend my ideas and my ideas were always different and I was always an outcast I guess to a degree and that certainly played a part later on in my life because it's been very easy for me to look at the programming The Matrix is trying to push down my throat and just say no did you discuss a lot of philosophy with your dad growing up was he a confidant in that way I know he's a chess master but was he somebody you pitch and catch with or was it most so you and your brother that that kind of pitch and catched a lot of these things early on my dad had his own philosophies I don't think we definitely never read any philosophical books we didn't study any but I mean old philosophers but he he'd say things now which you can even still see his Twitter if you want to see a philosopher you can go through his Twitter now and see all of the things he was saying when he was still alive yeah but I think life is actually pretty simple there's action and reaction there's cause and effect there's brave people and there's cowards a lot of people are self interested and if you understand the basis of these motivations it's not difficult to work out why the world functions the way it does and and calls and effect and action and reaction are very real and I think one of the largest plagues we have in the world today is a lack of action amongst people and deciding not to act is an action in and of itself right and and that's the only philosophy you need for life if you want something to move you have to move it if you sit and wait for somebody else to move it you're a coward and you're just hoping it's going to happen period absolutely and and and that's why I don't understand when a lot of people who who see where the world is going and see the future that's going to be laid out for their children kind of just hope and pray MH when they really need to be taking a more active role even if it's as simple as discussing every subject with anyone who will listen and try to open their mind open minds correct yeah now real quick I want to touch base one more time the young Andrew Tate when he was coming up and having these sorts of thoughts what were you like as you got into your teens were you a ladies man did you have a girl break your heart that first one I'm sure the stories are famous everyone's had their heart broken by a girl haven't they do you remember the first one that that really did it for you uh yeah everyone's had their heartbroken by a girl when they're a teenager I can't say her name because I'm famous now she isn't so I can't make her famous or anything M but uh I think everyone's had their heartbroken by a girl and and that's an important part of life I'm sure I'm sure every girl's had her heart broken by a man I don't think it's gendered I think that's just how the society functions that's how just how it goes well the reason I asked to is because a lot of people that we've interviewed a lot of highle entrepreneurs billionaires a lot of people who Done big things a lot of them had a chip on their shoulder early on even Will Smith talks about the fact that he wouldn't have been the biggest actor in the world if that first girl didn't break his heart cuz he current girl is breaking his heart I don't think he was worried about the first one he's worried about the one he's with now bro chip on his shoulder needs to get it back Jesus but was there ever anything like that for you like something when you were young you're like man I'm going to prove to the world like what started that fire inside early on or did it kind of just develop through time and get hotter and hotter well I think everybody has a fire inside of them but it's pacified it's deliberately extinguished by Society because one The Matrix wants you docile which is the first thing and second thing is people live lives of comfort a lot of people I think all men are born with a masculine desire to conquer Earth and I think you're only going to be happy if you're conquering but if you're living a semi-comfortable life and your mother is nice to you and you're not under any pressure and the Matrix is telling you it's fine to just be average well then you're going to be sitting there being average I I was never comforted I was never given an easy life I was never I never had anyone in my life who was saying don't worry Andrew it's okay to just be this guy I was told the opposite all the time mhm I don't know if the fire inside of me is any bigger than it is inside of every other man and I think that every man at home watching this if they don't have the things they want in life should feel a degree of resentment towards themselves or disappointment understanding that they have the same desire and drive that I have they just allowed themselves to be sced out of it they've allowed the Matrix or whoever to convince them it's okay to not be the man they could be and I never allowed anybody to do that to me I've had a lot of people try I've had girlfriend say Andrew you're rich enough and why are you going to jail and why all this stress why can't we just relax just just just be quiet just you know and and my mama has said it women usually cuz they protect that's how woman a woman will protect you right a man will die beside you a woman can only protect you by take by trying to convince you out of going to war in the first place mhm yeah and I could sit here and listen to them and say I've done it enough and I'm rich enough and blah blah blah then I wouldn't be me absolutely you know so and I think that people fall for that trap early on in life there's many stages of life you can be 5 years old and your mother doesn't want you to go boxing because you might get hit and the dad might be like yeah I guess a lot of it is feminine energy MH and then another huge part of it is is the Matrix Le propaganda because they don't like masculine imperatives because it defends the society which they're trying to destroy but I lived in a household where my father was in charge and my mother wasn't allowed to Baby us and we were always pushed to be the same way has Andrew Tate ever had a job oh yeah I've had jobs really what what what were your first jobs walk people down that lane I'm not a rich guy I'm just a poor guy with lots of money I am no but I mean that I've had jobs I I started off my first job I was carrying boxes of fish how old were you 15 15 that was your first job yeah there were like 25 kilo boxes of fish with ice in them and I was carrying them from 7:00 a.m. till 5:00 p.m. at a fish market mhm that was my first job I've worked in sales I was an IT technician at my school way yeah I've done I've done loads of things I've done load and T was on sales calls yeah absolutely yeah I've done I've done loads of different jobs and I'm very glad I grew up in the real world because I think that there's no light without dark and if you're born rich or you're born privileged you're going to have a particularly unique experience of misery because you're not going to be truly happy you're not going to understand why and no one's going to ever feel sorry for you or understand it because of course you're from a privileged background you're living this great life but you need to have had bad things happen to you for you to appreciate any of the good things you're ever going to have so in fact my when my brother and I talk often we talk about the stories from the bad days our best stories our happiest memories are when we were completely broke it's kind of funny how the good old days are constantly being lived and you don't appreciate them till afterwards but yeah I've worked a bunch of normal jobs I've lived a very normal life until I reached the highest Echelon of finances and I guess that's where you learn all the lessons on the way where you start from a single mother household on government housing all the way to the top to having companies worth billions of dollars and you pass through all the different stages along the way and you see all the different attitudes of the people as you go through it what were some of the other jobs if you don't mind me asking that you had you fish sales so yeah I worked in the fish market for a while which was fun but it was very physically intensive and I was training at the time I wanted to become a kickboxing world champion so I decided to get an easier job I got a job as an IT technician at my own school at my old school I was 17 then you went to college no I did go to college I went to college in England but I'm not sure how it matches up with the American educational system so sure I finished high school at 16 I went to college 17 and 18 when I was 18 and I finished College I went back to my old high school and worked as an IT technician but I got fired for sleeping with one of the students was she hot very hot she was 16 I was 18 I got fired and then uh they took I got fired from there and then I went and got a sales job how did sales sharpen you cuz I one of the common denominators some of the most successful people in the world has always been sales I did door to-door sales y I used to work uh selling solar I later worked at Tesla um and it was always in sales and it it sharpens you to a whole new level how how do Sal I think the best Sal I think the best sales people in the world are double glazing salesmen what is that Windows double glazing salesman why is that I think that must be the hardest sales job because if you sell cars s for example somebody turns up on the car lot and they've turned up at the Audi dealership because they have a degree of respect for the Audi brand and they maybe want an Audi and you have to convince them it's better than the BMW and make sure they can afford it and sell them the Audi okay fine but if you're going to sell somebody Windows they don't have any they don't they already have Windows in their house you're not turning up to some crack then with no windows so first thing you have to make them want the windows that's the first thing you have to to do you unsolicitedly knock on someone's door and say I'm here to give you windows and they're going to say I have Windows I don't want windows and then you're going to sit there and convince them that they need Windows and then once you've convinced them of that you have to convince them to choose you over all your competitors and spend thousands and thousands of dollars 20 or $330,000 replacing plastic and glass that they already had in their in their walls I think that'd be a very hard job to do and I think that that would make you a very good salesman um but life is sales in general right you have to be able to make people understand the way you think and I think that's all sales effectively is it's having thoughts and being able to project them in a way that people follow them logically and want to agree with you or inclined to agree with you at the end so I think life is sales getting a girl to fall in love with you to a degree is sales and convincing a judge you're innocent is sales and it builds tremendous character and resilience so we have to get used to being rejected yeah hundreds and hundreds of times over yeah it builds character and it's amazing how if you start a sales job and you're rejected at the beginning of such a big deal but after a while the rejection just doesn't sting anymore yeah which perhaps answers back earlier when we were talking about my confidence to sit here and say things that get me in trouble it just doesn't sting anymore did you this will come out and the BBC will type up something about what I said and how bad of a person I am and I won't care it just doesn't matter anymore so I'm I'm that guy now I just keep knocking at the door of Fate I keep knocking at the door waiting for them to eventually grab me and throw me in the cell so we'll see how it goes Switching gears a little bit let's talk about your desire to grow on social media yeah how much of it was to grow the business through e-commerce and online with infinite scale versus get your message to the world I'm sure it was a little bit of the two but when you were sitting there planning your social media three-step plan of attack what was the primary motive for you so the primary motive is that Co pissed me off Co annoyed me I lost faith in humanity during Co I couldn't stand people anymore I decided to become as well-known as possible deliberately so that I could get canceled so that I could drive traffic to my own social networks cuz I kept getting banned everywhere I've lost like 12 Twitter accounts I lost my YouTube I was banned on everything and then of course making money is very important when you fight a war and having traffic driven to my e-commerce products or my hust University is good because it allows me to fund myself in the war but I was already rich I already had a lot of money and the reason my school exists isn't for me to make money that's not why it exists I kind of it's interesting that you've asked me this question it's an amalgamation of lots of different ideas but I always had the intention of getting a network of people who understood how the world really worked and a place you could truly speak freely and then I want those people to be as powerful as possible I don't want the people who understand how the world Works to be brokies I want them to be rich because that allows them to fight against the Matrix and have some kind of influence you don't want a whole bunch of people broke working wagy jobs they can't do very much unless you want to have a violent revolution you want people who earn money online or geographically free or have large platforms or can speak aloud who aren't afraid of being cancelled to fight an information War so we ended up with this amalgamation of building my own social network and then me trying to teach those people to make money and me being able to speak freely inside of the network and that's kind of where the whole university came together and and formed into its current state we have over 200,000 members now so we're very large how important do you think it is for people to make money online with e-commerce hey guys we'll get right back to this video in a sec but first I have a quick question for you given that the e-commerce

for e-commerce into a thriving online business today thank you to Zen drop for sponsoring this video now let's get back to the show I think it's important for people to make money in a way that doesn't allow them to be cancelled and controlled it doesn't have to be e-commerce it doesn't necessarily have to be online although although that that's easier but the main reason that they're going to control you is because you have to pay your mortgage and they're going to hit you financially so if if you're working a job and they say take the vaccine it's very hard for you to say no when you have a family to feed and a mortgage to pay I would argue that a lot of people begrudgingly took it I probably think the majority of people begrudgingly took it because they had bills to pay MH so if you make money online sure it's harder to make you do that but you don't necessarily have to make money online you have to make money in a manner in which it's harder for the Matrix to force you to do things you don't want to do so you have freedom and control over your own and freedom of speech because a lot of people can't say what they think I want to ask you this um and it's related to the business side of things switching gear a lot of our audience you know we've interviewed a lot of billion dollar entrepreneurs a lot of high level people um we've had Patrick M David on the show who I know did a great wonderful interview with you uh he's a mutual good friend a lot of people wonder about how you built your Empire so I want to get into some of your mindset um you know before jail and all this talk to me a little bit about how you went from Z to a million million to 10 million and whatever your Shing just so people can see your mind frame you know what I mean like bus moves you made early on just CU a lot of our audience is entrepreneurial minded how did Andrew take go from zero to a million million to 10 that you're comfortable sharing and Beyond sure so first thing we're going to do is we're going to address this webcam thing because everyone asks me about it and a lot of people can flate my current scenario and the situation I'm in with this with my old webcam business even they not relate it at all was that your first business no I had lots of different businesses I did lots of different things I can give some general lesson sure which I think perhaps are better and we can talk about General ENT entrepreneurship but I want to address the webcam thing quickly because a lot of people think that was how I made all of my money and that's not true at all you make money by being perspicacious and indefatigable and you have to find disruptive Industries to a degree you have to be in before everybody else and I was involved in the webcam business long before it was mainstream and everybody else was doing it which is why it was lucrative for me MH I am from the streets I'm from the ghetto effectively I'm from a very bad area of England I grew up in a single mother household and everyone around me was dealing drugs and killing each other and stabbing and breaking into houses and stealing cars and all I did was Drive traffic to web pages and I did what I had to do to get out and now based on my Islamic reversion I'm not particularly proud of it but it's one of those things and you learn lessons along the way and I know i' haven't done bad to anybody I don't know I don't know I shouldn't have to be sorry for it because the people around me were doing far worse like I was Jay-Z sold crack nobody gives him a hard time yeah it's crazy so that was one of the ways I made money was that the first million no was that the first million I think I made a million before that but turnover and certainly not profit but the first million in profit the million I had in my bank probably came a little bit after that but it's amazing I guess the the overview lessons I'm going to give it's actually amazing how General business strategy can apply to anything it doesn't matter if you're running a webcam business doesn't matter if you're running a Car Wash if you understand the realities of how money moves and you understand the realities of business you're always going to be successful and you need to be able to apply yourself and work hard and all these things the the basic cliches that everybody understands yeah but I think in the world today a lot of business has changed and I'll be honest with you I actually think we're entering a brand new stage of how money is generated and I think all of the old models of how money is generated are going to fall to the Wayside pretty quickly such as I even think social media is going to have to change and I'm going to say this here in case I'm totally wrong and maybe I'll look like a fool or maybe I look like a genius but up until this point social media and all these large companies have made money by stealing your information and understanding how you act and operate by spying on you and then selling advertising yeah and I feel like the advertising model is even starting to die I feel like people who are most successful Now using social media are doing it by garnering attack garnering attention virally so they're getting free advertising effectively right and the the old model of just pure advertising campaigns doesn't work anymore and as AI comes into play and as video content can be created from anywhere as people decide to create their own realities and their own video games and their own movies they want to watch as opposed to watching anyone else's I don't know if anyone's going to be sitting there consuming these adverts like before even responding to them I don't know who even responds to adverts on Google or YouTube ear and these things anymore like they used to I just think the whole advertising model as a whole is going to fall and they're gonna have to find a brand new way to monetize I do believe it's an attention economy we live in I think you need to Garner attention and find a way to monetize off the back of it but I don't think that the traditional advertising model of these social media companies is going to continue for a very long time I think it's starting to fail and the reason I say that is I know a lot of people who run advertising campaigns now on Google and YouTube and these things and the return turns they talk about compared to somebody who lives true to themselves and has attention garnered via virality are minuscule and I don't think that the advertising model is going to continue to work for a very long time to make money in the world today you need to prove brutal competence and you need to find a USP which has always been the case you need to find a way to Garner attention which has always been the case I feel like when you say USP you mean unique selling proposition you need USP yeah you need a unique selling proposition but we're entering a very interesting stage and the reason I'm talking about this specifically is inside of my school hust University we teach artificial intelligence and I think AI is going to come and wreck the majority of people in the next 10 10 to 15 years maximum maybe even three to four years if you're not implementing it in your business now MH crypto was a disruptive industry and crypto was a play where if you believed in cryptocurrency early enough you could have become monumentally wealthy but I think the proposition of believing in cryptocurrency would have been a hard leap for most people to make if you talked about Bitcoin early on it would have been like Okay Internet magic money that's outside of the banks and it's going to go up and I'm going to make money that's hard to believe yeah there's no mental reference for there's no mental reference however AI is a much easier jump I think most people at home understand that AI is coming here and it's going to be here to stay and it's going to change every single facet of how our World operates right and you'd be a fool to not believe those things so you need to be in AI early like people got into crypto early crypto is a hard decision to make because it's a hard jump to make but AI is an easy jump and anyone who's not trying to build AI into their business right now whether they're a plumber whether they're a barista you can name anything there has to be a way to get artificial intelligence involved in the company you're currently running and learn how artificial intelligence works because I think that's going to be the future of the people who truly make it and those who don't and the reason is is because they talk about removing the link between your time and your money because if they're linked you're going to run out of time and you're never going to be able to get rich if you sell your time for money right but the machines never sleep and I'm already testing a whole bunch of theories and and and methods which allow us to use artificial intelligence to make a lot more money than we currently do and I can give you endless examples of it I'll give you a very simple example let me give you a hypothetical because I don't want to give away too many of my secret i' be careful what I say let's imagine right now I had a sales team MH and I would I had a sales team of 10 men I would try to build my own version of chat gbt or my own chat ball or I'd be trying to make sure that the artificial intelligence mind knows what it needs to know to answer questions and I would compare it against my lowest salesman my worst salesman and see how it does because firstly it's free effectively secondly it never needs to sleep and never needs holiday pay unless say it's only half as effective as my worst salesman that's fine if you can feed it double the leads if you can find leads now at low enough cost you can make more money from a free machine than you come can your least your lowest performing person and deal with the logistical complexity management absolutely so is that worth a try yes because across the next two to three years that machine is going to get better exponentially is the person who has been working for you for 10 years and is still your lowest salesman ever going to truly get better or probably not and I think getting in early and being involved in this disruptive industry at a point now where it's not mainstream is going to be the difference between the companies that survive into the future and those that don't because just like Bitcoin when everybody starts doing it a lot of the opportunity is going to disappear and I think that it doesn't matter what industry you're thinking of getting involved in now or what you're thinking of doing you should be looking at how you can use AI right now to make as much money as possible and that's the advice I'm giving to people and that's what we're teaching inside of our school as well in husters University every single camp campus we have a specific campus around artificial intelligence which we teach and every other campus all the other money-making methods we also teach how to integrate AI with them because I think the future is actually going to be people who can't make any money at all and then people who know how to make the machines make money for them that's where I think we're going to end up perhaps that's the future I'm betting on and uh if I'm wrong I've already got enough money so we'll see Sam Alman um from chat GPT talks about he believes that there will be billion dollar companies that are one two three three person Le compan power of AI let me ask you this how important do you think building a personal brand is in 2024 2025 and Beyond to growing a business it's credibility which is one of the most important things it's authenticity which is one of the most important things it comes with a lot of heat and a lot of smoke which I don't think many people are prepared for and it depends what you're selling I mean a personal brand is exactly that a personal brand if you have a company then your company has a brand ethos so you have to what's the point of a brand in the first place the point of a brand in the first place is credibility and relatability and authenticity trust and Trust so it has to be done at some regard at some level you can decide if you want to hide behind a company to protect your personal life or if you can be the face of your company yourself and suffer there's advantages and disadvantages to both your personal life suffers when you're a personal brand true but especially when you're Andre tap well yeah in my particular case but then also there's been massive and Monumental benefits there are some good things about it right so it depends what you want to do and what industry you want to get involved in a lot of people ask me about personal branding and come and say should I do a personal brand and I'd often argue that it doesn't matter if you should or not firstly can you can you do a personal brand and what do you reverse engineering or what are you optimizing for you know what I mean well yeah but I mean can you do a personal brand what about you as a person that's going to get people vested in you and if you actually go down the rabbit hole and analyze it you're going to realize that unless you've suffered and had a difficult life and have a bunch of interesting stories and War Stories and all the things we're talking about all the bad things you're going to suffer to build a personal brand anyway if you're born into a rich family and your life goes well and everything's fine and now you have a bunch of money and you try and start a personal brand based on the fact that you have money nobody's going to Care nobody's interested in all the good things that have happened to you and nobody's interested in how nice your life is nobody cares maybe if you show enough money you can get some temporary interest but not for long the only people who can build a brand off having a perfect life are women look I'm beautiful look I'm in Louis Vuitton look I'm skiing chicks can do that because they're physically attractive men can't all the men you can name with truly strong personal brands have very interesting stories and interesting stories usually involve danger risk pain suffering those are the things Triumph overc triumph over exactly so if you say oh should I build a personal brand well can you and if you can then perhaps you should consider it but if you can't then you have to sit and say well how could I and the only way you could is to suffer are you prepared to suffer in the real world not on the internet not pretending to suffer on Twitter are you prepared to suffer in the real world the genuine consequence and the genuine risk that it's going to take for you to be interesting enough for people to sit and want to listen to you for you to have a strong personal brand that's the actual question true when people say about personal branding because Batman's personal brand is kicking everyone's ass and he only did that cuz his parents got killed so you have to decide do you want to have your would you choose to have your parents killed to be B mhm at that level so cuz I think a lot of personal branding especially at the beginning at the beginning of personal branding you could buy a fast car and that was it you could rent a car and talk some [ __ ] but everyone's bored of that now right I kind of feel like I've raised the bar and kind of ruined it for everyone it's it's kind of million it's kind of hard now to like be interesting to like yeah but did they throw you in a dungeon of romanium no boring boring do you have a Bugatti I kind of ruined it yeah do you have a Bugatti Lambo broke no but like the Reon the reason I ask is cuz we have you know a big part of our audience we have a newsletter we have a school community and we teach you know different parts of personal bring so I'm curious if you have any tips obviously no one's going to go suffer yeah there's there's my there's my there's my tips for you go suffer and share those stories an empowering way with go suffer and make and tell people all the lessons you learned along the way and people will respect you knowing that you've been through something which is difficult respect has always lied on the other side of fear it still does right now the reason we all watch watch the big boxing match and have so much respect for the men who get in there is because it's scary to do and even if you don't cerebrally sit and think I would be scared to fight in Madison Square Gardens in front of all these people well then go sign up for a fight and you'll learn very quickly that you are scared because now you've even just started training for it you're nowhere near the event and you're nervous all the time and you don't want to do it because it's it's terrifying respect lies on the other side of fear so people are going to respect you if you do things that they'd be scared to do themselves and then they're going to say well I don't want to go through that cuz that sounds scary sounds terrible let me at least try and get the lessons from it and he's gone through it so I can learn from his experience or I can learn from his mistake I think as AI we're talking about them replacing salesmen well AI could replace a lot of personal Brands too now chat chbd is pretty good some people are so basic and so vapas and so thin that chat GPT could talk the same kind of garbage they talk unless you have some suffering to Anchor to how can you have any kind of personal brand at all it's and and maybe I'm just talking from my own experience because my brand is built on pain and suffering and maybe I'm trying to cope my way for having all the bad things happen to me that have happened to me but if I didn't have them all I don't know what I'd talk about would people listen would people care but what would I talk about I have a fast car okay I have a fast car but the coolest thing about me having a fast car is I grew up with absolutely nothing the coolest thing about me having a fast car is that they tried to take it off me and threw me in a dungeon the coolest thing about me having a fast car is when I'm get back in it after they failed to seize it off me when I was on an interpole red notice for garbage that's that's the cool part of it without the without the dark there's no light yeah there's no appreciation for the light it's interesting it's like you know kind of like you know we're working on getting Dana White on the podcast Conor McGregor on the podcast and so many people love Connor's story because it's classic you know he was a plumber in Ireland and he came from very humble beginnings dirt poor was trying to figure out how to make it work and now the story is you know people Champion him because they see versions of themsel in him right in their low situation their low challenge um you know and then today he's you know obviously been the biggest thing ever what are your thoughts on Conor mcgreer I like Conor I talk to him or connected with him yeah I have to be careful who I say I know but I've yet to meet him in person but I like Connor I have respect for anybody who stands up for what they believe in and I TR truthfully even if you disagree with me on every single subject if you stand up for what you believe in and you act remotely honorably I have respect for you as a person and it takes a lot of different types of people to keep the world functioning I don't like snaker and I don't like deception and I don't like dishonesty but I feel like Conor I'm sure we don't agree on everything I feel like he's an honest person he probably says what he means and means what he says and that's enough for me to to get my base respect as a man yeah and uh he has another fight coming up soon we'll see how that goes yeah who knows maybe after we'll organize a little round table me you and Connor that that would be a very interesting conversation we'll see how that one goes I'll work on it but yeah you're right his his Affinity was with the common man because he comes from a common place as do I but I feel like if you're trying to build a personal brand you need I think people now are looking for I think the internet landscape is also changing because I don't think people are looking to be just entertained anymore three or four years ago even five years ago you could be entertaining and people cared right because life wasn't perhaps as difficult as it was inflation wasn't so high whatever you want to call it but they just watch a show and go okay he's being a clown I'm entertained fine I think people are looking for answers now I think people are looking for Solutions and they're only going to believe and trust in the answers you give them if you've tried and tested them which requires suffering I think that the internet landscape is changing people aren't so interested in watching people just have fun anymore people aren't so interested in watching these idiots just put on makeup anymore now they want a solution for their problem because their rent is due and it must be paid well how do we find a person we can trust and why can we trust him and the easiest answer is well because I've been through x y and Zed that's how you prove you can be trusted how do you prove you have discipline run a marathon then you can prove you have discipline so for all the people who listen to your newsletter who want a personal brand okay go do something extremely difficult and tell them about it and tell them what you learned and prove you did it and then do something else and continue to compound all those difficult things in your life until you become a better version of yourself which makes you more competent which also amplifies your success and everything works together and before you know it you have a huge personal brand but if you don't suffer if you don't go through pain I don't know how you're even going to have one anymore well said well said now what industries would Andrew Tate get into obviously if you didn't have the heat of the universe and the Matrix on you and you were the average common man trying to come up in present day imagine you're in your whatever 20s 30s 40s restarting what industries would you look at as the biggest opportunity in 2024 2025 and Beyond yeah I think that aside from the double window uh industry you were saying right double glazing double glaze window industry yeah it's interesting because I feel like a lot of the tension geopolitically is going to be moving towards the global South in the second and third world and I think a lot of people understand there's always been more opportunity in the second and third world than in the first world where a lot of things are wrapped up I think the internet is giving a lot of access to these places that perhaps didn't exist before absolutely I think artificial intelligence involves in these places is also going to be extremely important I feel like selling information or being the barrier to information is a fantastic way to get wealthy in the world today there's a lot of people who want things explained to them in a very concise very quick very compendious way and if you can take information which is perhaps freely available that takes an hour to explain and explain it in 30 seconds or less you're going to find a way to monetize that right especially if you can draw attention to yourself and make it clear how much time you can save people especially if you could use artificial intelligence to get that 30 seconds down to 25 seconds right there's there's actually L opportunity if you're prepared to work I don't think that the problem is a lack of opportunity and I don't really even truly believe in saturated markets I still think that a lot of people would look at a lot of Internet businesses and go oh it's saturated let's take something that people have been doing for a while MH copyrighting copyrighting everyone's been trying to copyright everyone's done it well I would argue that there's a bunch of people right now making money from copyrighting as we speak who are idiots and who are lazy and they are still making money so there's such thing as a saturated Market because there's always a a huge subsect of that market which are very easy to out compete if you try your best and they're living from it which means you could take most of their business there's always a bottom percentile yeah so I think that you should be looking [Music] to when I say I I've said this on many podcasts before about selling information or garnering attention but I don't want people to confuse that with being a clown sure which is very different things I think that if you're prepared to suffer and you're prepared to show that your brand or your personal brand stands up for something and you have information which people then believe they need you're going to be very successful in the world today yeah and I love that you bring up not only AI but second and third world countries because um you know geoarbitrage is something very huge right for example I'm a partner in a recruiting company called A1 and we help people um get people on their teams at a much more cost effective price compared to you know a lot of the labor in the US so people overseas whether salespeople admin assistance customer support right there's a reason these billion dollar companies are doing it because they see the value in it where do you see the the labor force of second and third world countries and you know using that to grow the business you know what are your personal thoughts on that my personal thoughts are I don't know how people in the first world aren't extremely concerned you we're being replaced by effectively foreign call centers for a while that's something that's been going on for a while and now we have artificial intelligence and most people are so boring and uninteresting and they have not suffered enough to be unique therefore they're going to soon be replaced by a free chat bot right it's a free chat ball that could already replace a large subsect of the population as we stand right now imagine we're going to be in two or three years from now I think the average person in the western world hasn't woken up and realized that everything's becoming more expensive and your currency is inflated and there's no chance that anyone's going to fix it for you and they're out to replace you people from the second and third world who will work harder than you for Less money and a great job absolutely and the robots are coming and they're going to replace you for even less than the second worlders want and you're sitting there thinking you don't have to be exceptional and you don't have to learn to think outside the box and you don't have to suffer in any way to become a unique person and you're just going to somehow what pay your bills no you're not you're going to get destroyed hey guys real quick do you agree with what Andrew and I are saying here about the power of hiring second and third world talent to grow your business and buy back your time if you're a business owner you know that one of the biggest challenges is finding good quality hardworking Talent you can trust fortunately there's a solution A1 jobs.com A1 is a Global Talent company that specializes in recruiting the best of the best when it comes to finding sourcing vetting and placing key

video and now let's get back to the show destruction's coming for you and then you're going to become a useless person because you're not going to have a job that you're prepared to do at the price that people are prepared to pay and once you become a useless person you have to sit and go further down the rabbit hole of history and see what's happened to all the people of Earth that were useless what happened to all the people who had dreams and aspirations and expectations and they were no good to those in power CU I can tell you yeah yeah work that one out you're going to see very quickly that you're not going to exist for very long it's and and bro when I saw that Sora AI thing this is all the cameramen in the room including my guy I saw that Sora AI thing I was like bro even camera guys going to be gone soon Hollywood's gone actors are gone yeah script writers are gone right everyone's going to lose their job everyone you have to be sitting there and I don't know if the average cameraman sitting saying they're going to replace me with this maybe not now maybe not in a year but certainly in two they're going to be able to ask a robot for the thing I would take months to film and the robot's going to spit it out instantly so how do I a integrate this with my skills so that when they want to use the robot instead of asking the robot directly they ask me because they can get a better result via me how do I use AI along with my camera skills so I can continue to retain job or two how do I diversify what can I do that this robot can't do currently or I don't believe it will be able to do into the future but the average camera guy doesn't give a [ __ ] oh camera guy Sora yeah that's cool off the cliff oh I didn't see it coming how did this happen to me why am I unemployed you're a useless eater now enjoy the Concentration Camp that's what's going to happen so you have to be paying attention and thinking worst case scenario they're coming for absolutely everybody and everything and a lot of these personal Brands unless they're built on the back of a whole ton of suffering I think they're going to suffer also I I don't know how they're going to have a personal brand based on just talking motivational quote I haven't even done this someone should go to chat GPT and say some say something philosophical and motivational which inspires me and I guarantee you can start reading things and go crap that's pretty good oh no that's pretty good it's it'll be scary to read yeah it's an inevitable reality that people have to learn it's an inevitable reality and I don't think most people are even considering that they're replaceable or going to be replaced and seeing it early enough to Pivot and make it work absolutely it needs to cross your mind the one the one good thing about something like artificial intelligence is if you position yourself now if you get a position where you can use it before other people can then people will hire you to use it for them work with the machines you don't have to work against them you can work with them but firstly you need to learn how to use it and we will teach you inside of Huston's University which you can access but once again most people are stupid lazy or arrogant artificial intelligence is not too hard to use you can join our school and we'll teach you exactly how to use it it only 5% of people will be too stupid to do it the majority of people are too lazy to do it they're too lazy to join my school they'll sit here and listen to this whole podcast and then I'll say I have a school which will teach you how to use the machines to print you money and they're still too lazy to go and learn and they're going to wonder why they're broke forever or they're too arrogant I don't need the AI oh yeah it's probably something that'll exist and it won't affect me mhm good luck friend yeah no it's a good point and I love that you guys make it an affordable price point and people can $49 a month there's absolutely no excuse at all the only reason people do not benefit from musles University and make enough money to escape the matrix is because they're laser arrogant and you guys have hundreds of thousands of members hundreds of thousands of students recurring Revenue recurring Revenue 223,000 I think this morning I'll let people do the math on yeah we're doing we're doing okay all right now Switching gears a little bit you know everyone knows about the famous story of you getting thrown in jail yes talk to me about that story did you see it coming were you warned or was it just boom like that one day Everything Changes talk to me about the day you went to jail I knew what they were going to try and put me in jail for something I didn't know it's going to be as insane and crazy as it was I had prepared for it the best I could but I wasn't level for I wasn't ready for the level of Matrix attack I was subject to I was hit with an interpole red warning like I was hit with number one terrorist level attack mhm which was very interesting but yes I was in Dubai life was relatively good life was too good I said to Tristan life is too good something is going to go wrong he didn't actually agree with me when we got to jail he understood I was right but we were sitting I remember we were sitting we had this mansion and we had haggled for this Mansion this Mansion was I think it was $100,000 a week to rent and we rented it and then some guy came and offered $150 and then we offered 200 and and in in the end we ended up paying $250,000 a week for this Mansion so a million dollar a month yeah so we had this mansion on the palm because whoever this other person was was trying to get it off us and my brother being my brother had found these I don't know 20 girls from God knows where and they're all in the pool and we had our staff and our cigars and our shisha and our masseuses and my Bugatti's outside and I bought a McLaren and a Ferrari just because I was bored and we're in Dubai and everything is going perfectly well and I said Tristan something bad has to happen soon he goes why I was like look at this look where we are who are these girls what are their names like everything is too good something has to go wrong that's just how life Works he's like what could it be I was like well what's the worst case scenario and the worst case scenario is that one of us dies or gets in trouble so we agreed like okay for the next six months or so we don't go anywhere alone you go bathroom I go bathroom you go restaurant I go restaurant we roll as a team permanently we're like okay good right or die right or die so we had decided something bad was going to happen and I had already told many podcasts before that and made it clear that you get three chances and the Second Chance is put you in jail and I was like they're going to try and put us in jail but how can they do it I don't take drugs at this point I stopped drinking had you ever taken drugs never in my life I've never tried a drug in my life never even tried weed never no I know some idiot's going to sit and say caffeine and nicotine are drugs correct technically but I've never never tried any illegal substance in my life never tried steroids none of them so I've never tried drugs I've always been no test nothing I've always been firmly anti-drugs maybe it was it's a good question maybe it was the DARE officer I don't know what it is but I don't know I've always been super anti-drugs I just felt like if I try the drug and I like it I now want the drug which has to be bad for my life right and if I try the drug and I don't like it I'll wish I never never tried the drug so why Try it so I just never tried it plus I was a professional athlete for so long and when you get to a certain age having never done drugs I got to 31 or 32 and i' retired and I'd never tried drugs do I really need to start now plus some of the some of the drugs speaking as somebody who's a complete Layman to these things I don't know drugs but some of the drugs look semi- appealing but some of them really don't like cocaine I look at and I think okay if that gives you confidence and makes you feel hyper and happy I can understand why that's attractive but everyone I know who's ever done cocaine acted like an idiot and I didn't want to be an idiot so I've never been tempted by cocaine MH and then MDMA or whatever these other ones are ketamin or whatever MH you just lose your mind and jump up and down and sweat a bunch that doesn't look fun to me either right weed is the least appealing of all because people say oh but it's only weed but why would you want a drug that makes you just want to sit and watch TV and eat food I could do that without drugs I could be a lazy idiot without drugs just fine I mean magic mushrooms okay I think anyone with a brain would sit and go the idea of taking a mushroom and the whole room changing would be kind of cool but I still refuse to do it but the drugs that most people take I don't even understand why they take them most people have such terrible choice in life such terrible choices that even the drugs they choose to use are crap I I don't get it magic mushrooms enter an alternate reality fine but the smoke weed just to eat Popeyes delivery and watch TV I do not understand so I've never been tempted by drugs never did it so I couldn't understand how they were going to put us in jail but I knew it was coming mhm we left London flew to flew to England I did Piers Morgan called him an idiot left London he is left London and I was deciding do I go from London directly to Dubai or do I come back here to pack a suitcase and I flew back to Romania to pack a suitcase I was here for 8 hours called gr thunberg stupid with the pizza and then got picked up in the morning my jet was on the runway fueled and the police picked me up about an hour before I was supposed to go to the airport so they had been intending on arresting me for a while I understand what time was it that they came and got you 5: in the morning were you sleeping I was asleep and you know when I have armed security at the house and when I heard my door being busted my instant reaction after being woke up when I heard my door getting busted open it was like they've killed my guards because I didn't know if it was the police or the other team right and when they and I got my weapon and they busted in the door and obviously there's a bunch of them they're all masked up with shotguns Etc when I first saw the police it was genuine relief I thought it could have been the I mean I'd rather the police and crazy albanians right I really thought it might be the other team so when I first saw the P I was like thank thank God it's you what do you want they're like they're like oh get on the ground I'm like yeah I'll get on the ground whatever like what do you want yeah and then I worked out I was going to jail for human trafficking and all this inanity and I've told the story a bunch of times but I don't think I took it that seriously for the first three or 4 days and Tristan was there with you Tristan was with me uh when we first went to jail we were separate but during the arresting process when they were searching our house and stealing all of our stuff and taking our cars and taking all our diamond watches and everything my brother and I just kept looking at each other like like what this going this is no this is some sort of mistake but this is garbage we'll clear it up quickly yeah and we learned obviously that wasn't the case and they dragged us to jail and they threw us in separate jail sales and because of the time of year it was it was just before new year so the translators weren't working so all the paperwork was in Romanian I didn't even know why I was in jail I just knew I was in jail for human trafficking I didn't know who I didn't know when I didn't know anything for almost a whole full week till I found out the true Insanity that they had stuck on top stuck on me and I knew it was a matrix attack but I guess to this day even now I'm still kind of impressed how they've managed to construct such a garbage narrative out of trying to out of me and my brother telling people we know what time to do Tik Tok to be popular I mean that's crazy but that's how the Matrix operates right right and they didn't even show you I believe correct me if I'm wrong but I believe the paperwork when you went to jail was like not even in English oh it's all it's all in Romanian yeah so they they intentionally did it in a way to minimize your ability to navigate well the truth is this I don't think most people at home understand especially if you're a man that all men are guilty all of the time every man in this room is guilty of a sexual crime because the sexual crimes are now so subjective and they're so open into interpretation that if you upset the government and they want to attack you they will put you in jail for one of those crimes because it damages your reputation and a lot of these crimes are so subjective that it's impossible to even quantify what they are anymore they can call you emotionally cerve what does that mean that means you're nice to a girl so that she does something for you so if you say please baby can you make me a coffee MH you were emotionally coercive if fact I mean that's what they could do if they wanted to and when you understand that they use the process as a punishment I say this to people and they say but they can't put you in jail for asking your wife to make you a coffee I said no they probably won't put you in jail with that but they will accuse you of being emotionally cerve they will arrest you they will put you in the media they will slander your name they will make you pay millions of dollars of legal fees they will make you waste years of your life on bail and then you get to walk oh great lucky you the damage has been done the process is to punishment and any man who's living any type of life now in the world doesn't understand that he's permanently guilty of sexual crimes because all of these things now have been extrapolated to sub subjectivity and women are living in a in a society where they have all the power but no responsibility at all for their own actions that a woman can go through life and use her own agency to make her own adult decisions but if she regrets those decisions years later she can find a man to blame and that man's going to get wrecked you see it endlessly Mia Khalifa did porn porn had sex with hundreds of men made a bunch of money and now that she regrets doing porn she blames her manager for tricking her into doing porn and now it's a man's fault somehow and that's the world we live in so but I I'll be honest I'm a little bit mad at myself for not seeing it coming because before they hit me with this Matrix attack I really I really did consider understanding they're going to try and put me in jail that they're going to try and attack me with sexual crimes of some sort but I couldn't work out how they were going to do it right and then they made up the absolute garbage they did their intention was to put me in jail drum up a real case knowing that their initial case was garbage and they failed to do that they called 2,000 women who knew me and none of them said anything bad about me and it's all failed and they're forced to proceed with their first initial accusation is that I told girls what hours to do Tik Tok and here we are in the middle of the judicial process with it being thrown away little by little but the process is to punishment I've still been in jail for three entire months and a Manan dungeon I still locked in my house for 5 months I still haven't seen my cars or my diamonds or my gold or my bank accounts ever since how many cars did they sees 16 I think which is upsetting because it's almost it's almost 20% of my collection very UPS upsetting how many cars total I have 59 now 59 50 no sorry I had 16 and now I have none let me get that correct for the cameras um but yeah so the process itself is the punishment you still spend millions and millions of dollars in legal fees right they don't care they don't care if you're innocent or guilty they have no interest in that their goal is to teach you a lesson and to punish you I think anyone at home who doesn't agree with the following statement is an idiot if I wasn't so monumentally famous this wouldn't have happened to me this a simple statement if I wasn't so well known there is 0% chance the Romanian state would have tried to make an examle of me via proxy by putting me in jail for telling people what time to do Tik Tok they did it because I am famous proving in and of itself that it's not about Law and Order it's about damaging my influence because it's a matrix attack that's all it's about and anyone who thinks that the judicial system at the highest levels has anything to do with Justice is again a fool because it isn't it's about damaging influence and it's a big theater show I think there's another really famous person who's going through a bunch of garbage legal cases right now what's his name he was president pres or something can't remember but he's being hit with endless garbage and they're just wrecking him time and time again is that about law right before the election yeah interesting is that about law is that about what's right and wrong no it's about damaging a person's influence the judicial system is a weapon the goal of a judicial system is to preserve a degree of sanctity amongst the populace and to make sure that certain narratives are enforced amongst the population so the whole point of a judicial system is that people wake up underneath that system and feel safe or believe in the government or don't act completely crazy because of the law law and order so by extension if you have people at the top who are disrupting The Narrative and causing disruption to the population by making people think things they they're not supposed to think or say things they're not supposed to say it is the job of the legal system to stop those people right for the same reason you wouldn't allow somebody to start a cult which had heinous intentions you don't want an influential person to stand up and talk against your narratives which you're trying to instill to poison the minds of the children of the people who live inside of your country now I know what they're doing is evil we're not talking about right and wrong here we're talking about the goal of the legal system the goal of the legal system is to preserve the government's control and society's functioning that's the whole point of it so if they're trying to do evil things and I'm talking against it even though I'm in the right it is the legal system's job to deal with me that's the whole point the legal system to make people the legal system is supposed to make you act how they want you to act don't speed don't kill cool we all agree with those two we don't agree with the don't talk don't think part but they want you to do all of it and if you don't you're punished with the legal system so anyone who sits and says oh it's about law is a fool because that's not the that's not what it's about at the time top it's about damaging your influence because if you have a massive amount of influence you're a threat to them you're a threat to their narratives you're a threat to the information war and that's what we're living in we're living in an information War so two quick questions as it relates to the day you get thrown in prison obviously when the cops bust down the door it's you and Tristan there do you remember the last thing you uh told Tristan or the last like exchange it wasn't just me and Tristan there was also um some girls in the house and they busted in for human trafficking there's girls in the house my brother's girlfriend my girlfriend whatever they're in the house with us they didn't ask the girls how they are they didn't say girls do you need help they didn't try and take the girls away nothing you know the first thing they said to me where's the Bugatti first words they said to me no way I swear to God because their intention was to make an example of me and that was symbolic of My Success at the time the Bugatti was everywhere so they wanted to put it on a truck and say haha we took it off him if they cared about human trafficking why didn't they ask the girls how they were why did they drag girls from bed and put them in handcuffs by their hair why why why beat a bunch of women up I thought we're worried about women here I thought I'm a misogynist it's human trafficking now you got a bunch of women and you're hurting them whole thing's garbage whole thing's garbage they knew it was garbage everybody knows it's garbage the intention was pure the intention was to take all my stuff make an example of me put the bagatti on a trailer put all over the news haaha no one's more powerful than the government don't talk against the state throw me in jail once I'm in jail call everyone who knows me drum up a real case and screw me over they failed at the last part of that drum up a real case their current case isn't a case they know it's not a case and they're forced to see it through now because they couldn't find anything else which is also why it's so important that you live pure if you're going to talk against Authority because they're going to come for you and they're going to come for you for everything you've ever done every woman you've ever slept with every loan you've ever taken every sniff of cocaine you thought nobody would know about which is on some CCTV camera you didn't spot all of it is going to come out all of it so next time you're sitting there thinking I want to have an opinion but at the same time I want to do these Haram things or do these bad things and no one's going to know they are going to know that's why it's so important you live pure I'm sure they're very very disappointed that they didn't find the things they were looking for on me and anyone who attacks me in my character also isn't intelligent enough to understand that I've been examined by multiple federal agencies at the highest possible level for over three or four years and what have they found me making misogynistic jokes on YouTube oh well throw me in jail they didn't find anything weird they didn't find any pedophilia on my laptop didn't find any drugs in my house nothing what did they find Andrew said women can't park oh well he should go to jail and there's people so stupid that they'll buy into that narrative no one has a brain enough to sit there and go they've hit this guy England's tried America's tried Romania is now trying they've gone through his entire life all of his electronics they've been spying on him for years everything he says all of it and what they found is old YouTube videos that that's that's the open and shut case that I'm a bad guy I would argue if you were to get most men on the street and go through their lives and find all their deepest darkest secet Secrets you'd find a lot worse than what I've done maybe not even worse legally but worse reputationally MH you'd find him begging for some woman to take him back you'd find him with a [ __ ] in Thailand something weird what have they found on me nothing and there're still idiots out there who don't understand that so the legal system's job is to keep Society functioning and if they want Society to function with everybody afraid to talk and homosexuals in charge and you have to sit there and allow them to SC up your kids well then I am a target of the legal system because I'm against their narratives I'm a fugitive I'm a thought criminal the reason they hate me so much is because my influence is massive your ability to talk freely is directly correlated to your insignificance MH a lot of people sit and say oh we live in a free country you can say what you want well you can cuz no one listens interesting so start talking large enough for people to listen to you and you'll realize that you're not allowed to do what you want and this whole guise of Freedom we live under is a scam anyway none of it's real you're free to do the unimportant things sure you're free to chop your balls off congratulations but you're not allowed a free you're not free to keep them you're not free to keep your balls and stand up for what you believe in and protect your family you're not free to do that but you're free to chop them off which is why they come along and say oh look we're a free Society you can chop your balls off say well I don't want to do that I want to keep them thank you very much I don't want you to try and convince my son to do it either then you're going to realize that it's all a scam we live in a fish tank and you can swim around and the walls are glass so you don't really understand you're in a jail because it's glass walls and you can see outside of the glass and you see all this big beautiful room you think everything's fine but if you try and go too far you start bumping up against the glass wall you start to go too far all of a sudden your Banks don't work all of a sudden you're dangerous for any service provider to allow I'm banned from Uber they think I'm going to what get an Uber and convince the driver what am I going to do hey bro the Matrix and he's going to tell his next passenger like what why would you ban me from Uber not I took Uber anyway right when I got banned from everything you know the biggest try hard loser company on Earth Airbnb I'm G to say it now Airbnb are losers here's why when I was banned the day they deleted all my Banks they deleted all my things on the same day so on the same day I was banned from Gmail stripe Facebook Instagram five or six different banks Uber like every app on my phone just started logging out the same day you got arrested no this was actually during my first cancellation what was the time difference between the the money and account cancellation and then being thrown in prison August is when all of my apps stopped working August 2023 yes and then I went to Dubai okay and then when I got left Dubai I was arrested and they took all of my physical assets and how long was that after I was arrested in December so you you kind of saw the writing on the wall a little bit I went to Dubai for work and and and a little play yeah I mean I I have good friends in Dubai and I like the place and I went there for work and I'd just been cancelled so I knew that that they weren't happy with me I didn't expect to get picked up so soon I thought it would take a year or so or a couple years I thought I had more time to prepare for it but yeah I mean it's it's when I it's when they arrested they took all of my physical assets but when all of my apps stopped working when they deleted me off absolutely everything actually can I say this part we'll save this one I'll say I'll save that story for when I'm no longer in the judicial system sure part two part two we'll do part two and that's another thing that's very frustrating for me is there's so much I know I have to be careful what I still say because I'm still at Mercy to the Romanian judicial system but yeah I I did find I did find the Uber thing interesting and ask for the Airbnb thing so when they deleted me from everything at once I got an email from Airbnb the same day I was getting cancellation emails from everyone Airbnb emailed me says sorry Mr Tate because of your views and our community standards and our guidelines on inclusivity and blah blah blah you're no longer welcome to use Airbnb and they canceled me and I thought I don't even have an Airbnb account so I looked it up and I realized I was wrong I did make an Airbnb account four years prior and had never stayed in Airbnb ever never even stayed in one never even booked one right and on the cancellation day they jumped on in and stopped me from their service sorry Mr D because of inclusivity and I felt like replying I've never even booked a [ __ ] house through you clowns yeah and you're coming along trying to cancel me so I don't know I can't tell you exactly how it works I've heard theories that it's a cascading effect I've heard theories that after one company cancels you publicly and the media announces that cancellation the other companies don't want the smoke of not cancelling you oh yeah and I've heard other theories that there's actually someone higher up who makes the call and then boom pulling strings yeah I guess we're going to find out but uh it's certainly interesting and I I don't think most people at home understand imagine opening your phone in every app just logging out you want talk people say oh the Matrix is it real if you want proof The Matrix is real the day you open up your phone and everything starts closing down you're going to see The Matrix is very real wow now talk to me about the first moment you guys walk into a jail had you been into any kind of prison or jail before I've been arrested in England before for I was arrested on some garbage and I was only held for a day or so mhm but first day in jail in Romania what was it like like walk walk us through what's going through your mind you walk into the cell what happens jail is just condensed life you need to be strong physically so no one else picks on you and you need to be strong mentally so you don't pick on yourself and I was also pretty understanding that if you show respect to people they're going to show respect back to you I wasn't scared part of me was a little bit nervous but my genuine concern was for everybody else on the outside I know everyone was worried about me but I was worried about all the people I have to pay and my kids and my families and my mother and everyone else and all the heat they're getting and the smoke they're getting and them all being upset the first day I walked in there there was still a chance that I would be out relatively soon so I thought that this is a temporary Hiccup and it's garbage and it's something I have to deal with quickly it was only probably after a full week that it really began to settle in that I'm going to be stuck there for a long time and I was hearing a lot of horror stories from people around me who had been stuck in the system for years and they gave you no context of how long you'd be there or nothing everyone was telling me I was going to be there for years really guys in my room when I first went in there all of them had been there for between 1 and a half and four years without trial and when you walk in there is everybody like holy [ __ ] Andrew Tate's in the house or was it was there not that kind of reaction they knew who I was but not really I think a lot of them I think after a lot of time in jail maybe not in a western jail but in a jail in this part of the world you lose a lot of your what's the word I'm looking for sentience you lose a lot of your sentience because the only way to survive it is to just be half asleep right right does that make sense yeah you're kind of num and not and not even asleep physically but just mentally half asleep they were like oh Andrew Tate yeah like yeah they didn't no one cared welcome to the club yeah just like welcome to the club you got shafted by the system yeah and it's amazing because systems are imperfect because they're run run by people and people are fallible and of course when you call the police after after someone's committed a murder you want that murderer to go to jail and the judicial system does its job some people who do bad things are in jail which is what you want but there's also a bunch of people in jail who are just in jail for some garbage and of course the person you're asking why why they're there are you hearing the real version of events who knows but in every single jail on Earth I would argue there's a percentage of the population who shouldn't be there there's at least between 1% perhaps up to 30 40 50% of men sitting in a room stuck there who should be in jail if all was fair in the world and the world's not fair and after I started to realize I might be there for years because a lot of the people in there some of them and I won't tell their stories out of respect were there who had done nothing wrong and they've been stuck for years my concerns weren't for me my concerns were for my Empire on the outside because as a man you have a lot of people who depend on you what were the conditions like inside there they were exactly how you'd imagine a Romanian jail to be I mean Romania is technically a poor country if you actually ever visit here you'll see a lot of fast cars and Lamborghinis and nightclubs and bottles and there's a big wealth divide there's a lot of money here but technically on paper in general is one of the poorest countries in Europe how can a politician justify to his constituents that he wants to send money to improve the jail system when they have medical problems with their Health Care system and the roads have holes they have other issues to fix the pensions need paying I don't think they put any money into that jail since it was built W during calling M and a and a jail in communism is a dungeon to go and die in mhm and there's also the starkest reality was that there is no mental health divide between the criminal justice system and the mental health system in poorer countries I prob it's probably not Romania it's probably most poor countries in a poor country they don't have the money to work out if you are a criminal or if you're mentally ill you're just not doing what you're supposed to do and you're a menace to society so you all go to jail so there's a huge mental health problem and I'd argue it's probably like that in a lot of poor countries was there multiple people in the cell with you or were you solo before Tristan in in the cell so it was at first my brother and I were separate I was in the room with three other guys three other men and my my first con my concern initially was to make sure there was going to be no physical confrontation but I I'm pretty good at picking up Vibes and I understood pretty quickly that I'd be okay Tristan had a semi different experience and then after two weeks I was put in the same cell as Tristan we were put together and we were put together so they could bug the cell and listen to us oh and you guys of course knew that yeah we knew that instantly you're probably [ __ ] around but we but we were yeah of course but we were glad that they put us in there and I've told my story about Ricky tan and Rush shower and how we started talking about all these imaginary crimes and we did it one was to upset them but two our logic was if we make them feel like they're getting something out of this they'll keep us in the same room and it's better so let's keep alluding to these crime bosses in Hong Kong we kept describing the rush hour plots so they're listening in calling the Hong Kong authorities probably but um but I mean I'll never forget the day I they told me I was going to leave jail I'll never forget that day I'll never forget that emotion well in there you know I know there's a famous question where someone said you know Andrew did you cry in jail yeah and you said I said tears ran down my face but I did not cry and what did you mean by that because it it's a unique feeling of frustration unless you've ever been in that scenario you never would have experienced it in your life you're put in a room the the door is locked okay and for the first few days you're in jail whatever but after a couple weeks you just look at the door and you're like how can I not leave this room why can't I go outside of this door it's and all the other scenarios in your life where perhaps you're put in a room you have to argue with your parents or you're you've got a job and you can't finish till a certain time but you could leave the room if you actually wanted to walk out you could walk out there may be consequences but you could sure but in jail you actually can't yeah and it's very frustrating and I think my brother actually did better than me because my brother the whole three months in jail didn't make a single phone call didn't call anyone once didn't care I was calling people trying to check on them making sure that everything was okay and I thought that would make my life better and everyone else's life better but did the opposite because it it made me very concerned and it's also amazing the difference between men and women because I'd call like my guys or my or men who I rely on or people who I do business with whatever and they'd be like don't worry we got it you just worry about you we got it we got it we got it you'd call the women and the women in your life obviously have been depending on you while you're free and they just start getting upset crying but what if you're there for years and how will I pay for this or what's going to happen about this or what if know the kid and and all of their negative emotion they they're not cerebral enough to go he's using his 20 minutes Jail phone call yeah and instead of making him happy I'm just going to trauma dump himh and and it's kind of it's quite a Sur surreal experience to be in a jail cell counting the Cockroaches on the roof on a broken pay phone trying to convince some girl in the Free World that she's going to be okay you're like you're you're playing the other side you're like don't worry it's going to be fine and you're the therapist in the jail which shows the reality of masculine versus feminine when things get hard anyway yeah but I was that day I was particularly upset but it wasn't about me I I never felt sorry for myself at any point I never looked around at any point and said oh this is unfair I can't believe this happened to me even though it is unfair and even though it is a matrix attack that's not a paradigm I operate under I only looked around me and said I need to get out here because there's other things I have to do and I'm worried about everyone else I really wasn't that concerned if you would have said to me when I was in jail Andrew you're going to be here for 10 years but x amount of million dollars a month will be generated and this these people will be paid for and this is the life they're all going to live that I really would have been like okay and I would have done my time it's it's concern for other people as opposed to over myself I wasn't worried about me so much and because truthfully although I did nothing wrong or that's that's incorrect even though I was thrown in jail for a reason that didn't exist for a crime that didn't happen all in all I feel like there's no light without dark in the universe if I were to say to you it's a genuine question if I were to say to you at the age of 18 when you were carry let's say you had a job like me or I say to myself I'm carrying boxes of fish in a fish market at 7 in the morning for $40 a day and they were to say Andrew you're going to become one of the most well-known people on the planet and you're going to stay in a mansion in Dubai that's a million dollars a month and you're going to have all these beautiful children with all these beautiful women you're going to drive a Bugatti and have 59 cars you're going to fly in private jets and you're have this big mansion in Romania you're have all these things but at some point you're going to throw you in jail for no reason I would have signed that piece of paper instantly I would have taken that contract who wouldn't you have to be a total [ __ ] to not take that deal so all in all there's no light without dark so I didn't feel sorry for myself I understand you can't shine bright in the world without casting a shadow and the shadow is where your enemies are going to attack from and sometimes they'll get lucky and they'll hit you with a side swipe and you'll fall over and you're going to get back up I never felt sorry for myself it was the Monumental responsibilities I had on my back and everyone else's Panic around me and you can also extrapolate that out towards life in general where when I was only talking to Tristan or I was only talking to the strong people in my life I felt fine but as soon as I talked to someone who was weak I felt bad and you can also use that outside of jail yeah the power of environment 100% quality friends around you quality support system and your circle absolutely I I tweeted the other day and it got me a lot of heat I tweeted that male therapy is your friends just calling you a [ __ ] until you don't mention it anymore and everyone was like that's not therapy and everyone had a mental breakdown but if you go to your boys and like oh she left me don't be gay get over it eventually you'll stop saying it and eventually you'll get over it MH but if you sit and you say she left me or whatever bad happened and they sit there and they cry back and everyone one's sad that it drags you down the rabbit hole so it's also very important that you create your reality so you're strong as possible and I believe that your friends in a masculine environment the primary objective of your friends should be I like to say to my friends that if I'm with my guys my my enemy feels harmless my enemy doesn't feel capable when I'm with my team now my enemy is still very capable but they feel less capable which is stupid because my enem is the government and the government the biggest gangsters on the planet they can kill me and they can still throw my ass in jail but I'm with when I'm with my guys I'm not afraid of it even now post jail I live with all my best friends we have this big house and we live together and every day we laugh are they coming today are we going to jail today who knows jail bags packed it's all a big joke if I was living with just my woman and my kid I'd be far more nervous and scared are they gonna bust in the door are they gonna kick my kid she's young are they gonna you know she the woman's scared I'd go to bed worried each night but when you're with your guys you feel Invincible I think that's something inside of men that we've evolved to have is something biological inside of us because when enough men are in a a large group we'll charge at gunfire yeah camaraderie yeah if everyone starts going over the top screaming you'll jump over the top and scream it's something inside of us so that was the thing that was interesting about jail you learn how I knew I had massive responsibilities in life and that was no realization to me but the realization was that even in your most difficult periods of your life you're still a man and the people who rely on you are still going to rely on you andh you're still going to have to find a way to perform and I did it because I was prepared for it and all the bills were paid and everything was fine but it was very interesting that I'd use my jail calls trying to cheer people up as opposed to being cheered up yeah how how did your Brotherhood with Tristan grow in jail we were in a Cell the same cell I think for 81 days and the cell was when I say tiny imagine imagine a bathroom it's about the size of a bathroom and we never argued once about anything ever is there beds in there is it co yes that's right so we had a bunk bed and who got the top bunk no we had we had two there was four beds there was two sets of bunk beds but got but when they put us in the bugged cell there was they left two empty so we both had we both had these bot bunks and then our free space was around the size of a bathroom in general and it was cockroaches and there was a hole in the floor and that was it and we had a tiny Window M and that was the experience and so you literally go from like Dubai Mansion Bugatti on the thing Yachts girls the whole thing to like cockroaches and double bunk PS isn't are I lucky no but I'm and I'm saying that without hyperball are I fortunate maybe this is the wrong way to frame it but I believe it is the best way to look at the scenario I think that makes me Hyper fortunate wouldn't it be beautiful wouldn't it be amazing to be in the Sahara Desert and be extremely hot and dehydrated and and almost about to Sunburn and then in a Flash instantly in a ice cold Nordic pool with unlimited fresh water imagine the the the change in Circumstance the ju Theos between the two how crazy it would be if you take a plane between the two you lose the effect it needs to be like teleportation the instant people get out of the sauna and they jump into nice bath for a reason I literally went from yes private jets and Bugattis and being the most famous man in the world living in a mansion to that dungeon so quickly and I feel like that puts me in a very fortunate position because it allowed me to recalibrate and it's certainly a unique experience of life and what are you looking at life for are you looking at life to be as comfortable as possible or are you looking at life for the challenges and for the stories I would argue that if Tristan went to jail without me I would have been jealous when he got out right or die well one because I wanted to protect him but two if he told me what he went through I would have been jealous of him now obviously there would have been no animosity because we're brothers but I would have been like wow that sounds cool that sounds fun there's some people who want to go through life and be as comfortable as possible but if you're the kind of person who wants to challenge yourself I'd argue that being thrown in a Romanian dungeon is a challenge being thrown off the back of living the most luxurious life that money can afford is a challenge trying trying to find a way to escape and preserve your mental rigidity is a challenge and I'm very glad God gave it to me and and I also I'll say this right now here on camera part of me a a a huge percentage of me will be disappointed if I don't go back and I know that sounds crazy because I feel like I don't care about what the media are going to say and I know I've done nothing wrong and God knows I've done nothing wrong I'm not interested in any of that but when I'm 70 let's will it be cooler if I had to go back and do 5 years in the dungeon or will it be cooler if I spent those 5 years flying around on Jets and sleeping with beautiful women and being Mr rich I mean okay maybe the Mr Rich stories will be cool I'm not going to complain they'll be fun but part of me will always be in the back of my mind for the next few years when I be after I bust this case which I believe is going to happen I don't think I'm going to go back if I was in jail would would the would my life story be cooler would the lessons be worth more than what I'm currently doing and maybe that makes me insane maybe that makes me nuts I don't know but I'm really not afraid of it it's up to God and God will decide and Allah is the best of planners perhaps I learned all the important lessons I needed to learn in those days and if I haven't he's going to put me back in there we're going to find out and there's a beautiful saying too in Islam as I know you're Muslim where God doesn't put anything on the soul that it can't bear absolutely and so there's there's a Divine meaning in it obviously time will tell but I want to ask you this too um and this is really interesting before I forget is when you were in prison I heard someone ask you something to the effect of you know how did you spend time what did you and Tristan do and you said that you did like x amount of push-ups yeah what did you do to be as productive as possible in there whether you and Tristan or solo what did you focus on what was your mental frame of mind it was fantastic for so many things J J was fantastic for training how many push-ups did you do in there I did a th push-ups a day every day every day anything else in the workout I did a th push-ups a day I did like 300 or between 300 to 400 squats a day and then I had no weights and we had no access to a gym so I had a sixpack of 2 L water which weighed around 12 kilos mhm and it would it usually it'd be around 4:30 by the time I'd finish the push-ups I remember and between 4:30 and dinner so that's 2 hours at 6:30 we got fed I'd lift the the water above my head over and over and over and over again as many times as I could so you literally got stronger mentally and physically in jail absolutely and it was fantastic for training I kind of miss that single-mindedness I had in jail now I don't do a th000 push-ups a day not because I can't but because I have things to do and I have work and my phone's ringing and I've got things to do on my laptop back then it's like I'm going to do a th push-ups and I have nothing else to do that single-mindedness was actually quite beautiful because in the world we live in today we're all permanently distracted at least half of the time at least a fraction of you is always thinking what's on my phone what's that person doing what's this girl doing or what's this work I have to do but when you're in jail after a while you lose access to any anything outside of your immediate so you focus on the immediate it's like going back in time mhm you know you remember the '90s you remember maybe I'm an old man the early 2000s before we we lived inside the Matrix and the metaverse when you were just in a room with someone and that was it MH I had conversations in jail me and my brother would talk for days about the same subject we've never spoken like that since there's been time I've said this to Tristan only a few days ago two days ago we're having a cigar in the cigar room and we we were talking about something I was like we talked about this for half an hour we would have talked about this for days in jail weeks perhaps so much magic Is Lost outside and outside of a jail cell so what a blessing from God that I got to experience that for those three months and be cerebral enough to retain those lessons or at least be aware now of what I'm missing in the real world because you don't realize what you're missing until you're put in a position like that and what suffering did I have to go through to get such a blessing from God well I had to deal with the media saying bad things about me but I don't care I genuinely don't care they can print bad things about me for the rest of my life I'm not going to shut up I don't care I had to deal with the Cockroaches which and and the and the bed bugs and the spiders which I must admit was probably the worst thing about jail and I had to deal with some nightmares when I got out but all in all and I was saying this to Tristan in jail we were sitting there I was saying we we'd often have conversations when we were at our lowest when we felt particularly depressed we'd say let's let's name things worse than jail oo friend control yeah yeah cuz we're supposed to be in a bad situation now the worst of the worst what's worse than jail that can happen in everyday life well cancer is worse than jail a car crash is worse than jail getting drafted into a war you don't want to fight in is worse than jail I argued we started finding and over time we ended up with a huge list of things to every suffers from every single day that are worse than a jail cell yeah there's there's a beautiful quote by Tony Robbins he talks about nothing in life has any meaning except the meaning that we give it and so the fact that you guys were giving it an empowering meaning you own the narrative it didn't own you oh absolutely my enemies think they damaged Me by putting me in jail all they've done is make me more powerful and give me a story and give me an experience and make me more aware and acutely interested in ensuring that I am I wouldn't say present because I've always understood that I'm you know semi- distracted and busy people always are but I kind of feel like would I be crazy to call it a uh Health Retreat you know like like kind of like a mindfulness Retreat I went to a mindfulness Retreat and because of the and we we'll say the insects were nature I went to experience nature in a mindfulness retreat with my best friend and brother and and there was no distractions they only allowed me to have be distracted for 20 minutes every two days with the jail phone and besides that I had to focus on what I was doing at the time lucky me how did your and kind and and that and I kind of want to go back how did your faith grow your relationship with God I know that uh you also you know in your recent years have reverted back to Islam and being Muslim when did that occur specifically and what led to that series of events did jail play a role in that I always had massive respect for Islam and I'm very careful what I say because I don't want to offend any other religions because I think that anybody who is living true to God and they believe is the correct religion is somebody who I respect but I feel like it's the last True Religion on Earth in the west at least if you look at Christianity it has no meaning anymore I don't know how you can be a true person of religious conviction and faith and then call yourself a Christian without feeling not embarrassed but at least angered within the context of the religion itself but how it's implemented and how it's right they they stick up for what they believe in MH if you don't stand for something then you don't believe in anything if you don't have hard barriers if you're not prepared to say no to certain things and certain ideas then you don't believe in anything Islam is simple book says no Haram next that's it Christi yeah and Christianity is is super subjective now MH and there are things that everybody knows go against Christian teachings and they know go against the Bible but the church and the culture of Christianity we were talking about culture earlier proves how important it is is so accepting of everything that they have no firm barriers and they don't believe in anything anymore and if you the point of a religion is to have restrictions that's where the faith comes in if you can do whatever you want then it's not a religion is it yeah and if you'll ignore all the rules of your own holy book then it's not a religion either and I just feel like the fact even that Christianity is so openly mocked and Christians don't stand up and defend it is again proof that the religion has lost a laot of its power and I think my respect for Islam is in the very simple fact that they stick up for what they believe in and they mean what they say and they refuse to be mocked and I don't know you can apply that from a religious perspective but you can also apply that from a general perspective of Life as a man I think any man with self-respect doesn't want to be mocked and he doesn't want his views to be mocked about anything mhm and if you're going to believe in a religion you should at least respect it and I respect their rigidity and I respect that people treat them in a certain way because their religious convictions are true we can go down the argument of which religion is true which religion is right but I think we could all agree and even Christians will agree this with me that it's a sad State of Affairs where Christians will allow their Prophet or Jesus to be openly mocked and they won't say anything about it or do anything about it just allow it to happen within Christian nations I think we can all agree that's sad and it's beautiful to be part of a religion where you don't have to suffer that embarrassment truthfully how did Islam change you personally because I'm sure there's been an internal shift right not just the religion but it gave me it gave me a lot of clarity and it gave me a lot of peace and it confirmed a lot of things I already knew were right and already knew were wrong it change reverting to Islam didn't make me say ah okay this is now wrong and I used to believe it's right there wasn't very many of those it was far more I always knew this was wrong and now I'm glad I get to read the Quran and be told a new reason why it is wrong MH and it gave me a lot of Peace because you have to live for something and everybody's trying to live for something outside of God and truthfully you're going to get to a point in your life sooner or later where you realize Nothing Else Matters MH and you're going to come to a conclusion especially if you're monumentally successful that all the things you think you own you don't even own and that you don't have control or power over very much and the only thing that's going to give you true satisfaction in this world is waking up and knowing that you're doing the right thing because it's what you believe is right and you have the faith and the courage to continue to do that despite your persecution and ultimately if what you are doing is trying to take care of your children and Preserve soci Society so they have a world to grow up in which is worth living in that is the the will of God and the act of God and I think that having peace and Clarity in regards to knowing I'm living for the right thing was the biggest change I wouldn't say it changed many of My Views it just made me feel more at peace with the suffering that comes with doing the right thing is that makes sense and you know it's interesting because I'm actually a Muslim as well and I want to ask it's very interesting that use the language revert to Islam versus converted to Islam yeah I'm curious I know I understand the answer but I'm curious if you could elaborate because I'm sure there's people wondering so why do you use the language of revert to Islam versus con convert to Islam yeah I I was corrected on this and someone said to me that we andate was corrected yeah I've been bro my whole life my whole life my whole life has been corrections I just I'm just good at listening you know I just pay attention but we all start off as Muslims is the intention right you can probably explain it even better than I can yeah but um and and especially when it comes to the Islamic Journey I'm paying a lot of attention and I'm learning as much as possible because there's a lot to learn especially when you're not born into the faith right there's certainly a lot of studying to be done but it's interesting when you said Andrew Tate was corrected yeah absolutely I I'm only I'd like to believe the only reason I'm so good at trying to make people understand what I think and teach people things is because I was such a good student for so long I spent most of my life listening mhm one of the weirdest things about the internet is I see all these 21 22 23 year old kids talking about how life should work and they have it all figured out yeah they all figured out they're in Miami and they've rented a Lambo and they're by the course for 997 king of the world I spent my 20s shutting up and doing as I was told I only became a world champion kickboxer because I listened to my coach I only became wise because I listened to my father I spent most of my life listening before I started to talk the internet's kind of accelerated it now where people are getting a voice much earlier on but before the internet you didn't get rich at 21 unless you were born rich how yeah and and you didn't have a voice at 21 because no one would listen to you you know so you had to have that age to have the real world successes and the wisdom and with that age you often learned the life lessons that allowed you to teach people things but I've been I've been a very good student for a very long time and I like to pay attention to things and I'm constantly being corrected all of the time and now especially you can call it God you can call it Universe you can call it life there's lots of different things you can call it but the feedback I'm receiving every single day I'm trying to pay a lot of attention to and we can even apply it to other things right so I understand that I was joking when I said some of the videos that when I made some of the videos I've made that have been used against Me Now by the people who are saying I'm a misogynist when I'm not a misogynist everyone with the brain knows I was joking that's true but I would be a fool to not sit and say okay well now I'm monumentally more famous I have to be slightly more careful how I say certain things in case they're weaponized right you have to take feedback from things in life and use it to your advantage all of the time right so I'm I'm constantly and always trying to do that and jail was a fantastic example of it but I one of the things I like most and I won't say their names but there's a few very prominent Muslims who I'm speaking to every day and learning from them and the lessons in it are so important and so pertinent and the only reason I believe I'm going to get where I want to get it's because I'm a good student and I'm prepared to listen and learn MH and there's a lot of people in the world who aren't prepared did listen and learn and I find that quite interesting and I don't think it's because people are stupid I think the majority of people are actually brutally arrogant M cuz I've had a lot of people ask for my advice on different things as well and when I try and give it to them they just start arguing with me back I don't know if you ever had that someone come to me say I want to be successful I want to be rich like okay you need to do this oh but I can't do that because of why did you ask me then yeah why did you ask me if you have all the answers yeah if you have all the answers why are you not where you want to be yeah there are three reasons most people are not successful in life it's either stupid lazy or arrogant I think less than 5% of people are too stupid to get everything they want I've yet to see anybody truly dedicate themselves to Something in life and not get it I've never seen somebody get up at 6 a.m. every day go to the gym every day eat right every day and not get in shape now I've heard people say they're going to do it and not do it or say they're doing it and lie or say oh but my thyroid are every excuse Under the Sun but I've I've yet to see anybody body just do it and not get the result they wanted MH and it's the same with most things it's the same with making money not many people are too stupid to make money not many people if you were to give them the formula the blueprint and say here do exactly this copy it and do it word for word would be too stupid to interpret what they must do but people are too lazy and they are too arrogant 5% of people are too stupid the majority of people are not where they want to be whether it's physical Financial anything else mental spiritual because they're too lazy or they're too arrogant and laziness is is a is a Scourge but I think arrogance is the true one where people just truly they want the answers they want the shortcuts but when you're actually trying to explain it to them they have all the answers Under the Sun as to why they can't possibly do it or it doesn't work for them or yeah I can't go gym at six because of traffic and I have a thyroid problem and that it's all arrogance it's all just trying to pretend they're special and different and better than everyone else and it's it's not the case so what about things you do to stay in with the heat of the pressure you know the world on you the Matrix after you I've adopted all of that into my everyday life I don't have time to sit and deliberately do something specific to keep myself grounded what do you do for fun I'm I'm I'm ready for all of it all of the time you know maybe I've lost my mind I'm ready right now for someone to walk in here and for us to all fight to the death and end up covered in blood I'm ready also to have a nice meal smoke a cigar do a podcast ready to go home make some money ready to go make another child with my beautiful girlfriend ready to drive my Ferrari or my as Mar or my Lamborghini I'm ready for it all I'm permanently ready for all states of life it's fine and as for fun not sure I believe in fun it's fun a thing is fun real isn't that just made up I'm not sure what fun is I I really truly enjoy purpose much more than fun if you were to say to me Andrew this will be fun or I could clear my notifications on my laptop I'd probably choose to clear my notifications gives me a sense of peace peace is fun and when your life is chaotic like mine it's only peace that will be truly valuable I do like to drive super fast cars I drive cars around that's fun to give a simple answer but truthfully I look for peace all the time because my life is chaos and my life is War and the most fun thing I could do is nothing most fun thing I could do is go to the dolomites in Italy and stay in a five-star hotel and Overlook the Alps and sit with one or two or four or five beautiful women in my bed and just do nothing that is the most fun going to a club is not fun going out and trying to find fun is what you do when your life is not chaotic enough when your life is truly chaotic fun is doing nothing and I have plenty of chaos I had a conversation with a girl the other day and she was talking about swimming with sharks and I was explaining to her that she's crazy and I would never do that and she said oh but it's exciting it's dangerous and I said see this is how you know you have a nice life when your life makes you want to go swim with sharks because you're looking for danger and excitement that shows your everyday life is nice when I leave here I have to make it all the way out of the hotel without getting assassinated or arrested I'm going to be nervous I'm going to be on edge and I'm not going to be happy till I'm in my armored car with my armored with my armed guards that's Swimming with Sharks walking to the car that's my life now I'm stressed walking to a car I do not need to go anywhere near any sharks stressed enough so fun is doing nothing doing nothing is fun how about Mario Kart I know I've seen videos where uh you play some one of the one of the video guys who works with me is so ridiculously good at Mario Kart it upsets me in my heart I've only played him once yeah and I can't stand losing and it was so ridiculous we had to spar afterwards I had to be a up it upset me deep and I've never played since and I never will yeah yeah he's the best it's funny I asked because we're actually thinking about starting like a video game streaming thing on kick or twitch or whatever we're talking about interviewing people while playing the video game so it's cool we'll have to play Mario Kart perhaps Mario Kart there's a couple games I'm okay at but I'm not a video gamer but if you do start that channel let me know we'll see what we can do how about FIFA ah don't know I can't play FIFA I've only ever played I've only ever played Super Smash BRS it's the only game Super Smash Brothers the only game I can play how about Mario party never played it never played that game nice I've been busy I was in jail bro we didn't have we didn't have Nintendo in Romanian jail we just unfortunately no makes it's not an English jail I'm sure in English jail you get Nintendo and a flat screen TV and everything but yeah well the reason I ask is cuz I'm so curious you know you talk about beating the Matrix and you have the world on your side and obviously you got people in power that are not exactly on your side but I'm curious for you to interrupt you sorry there go ahead are the people in power on anyone's side does anybody in any country in the west now agree with anything their politicians do this is a I'm actually asking this question every time I see a politician talk I think you will not find a single person on the street who agrees with that crap they we don't want to bomb these countries we don't want to give money to these places we don't none of these things they're doing anybody wants us to do democracy in action huh I don't they're not on my side they're not on anybody's side it doesn't matter if you're in France Germany England or America I can't find a single Democratic Nation where any of the decisions they make benefit their own people ever and anybody agrees with it at all it's a miracle it's still being it still operates it's a miracle somehow they're still pulling it off where they stand in front of us and go you're all going to pay loads of taxes we're not going to fix your roads you can't afford to eat groceries we're giving a 100 billion to someone else thanks bye going home now for the day oh and my wages have been put up what this clown world of course they're against me they're against everybody and what do I do I tell people to think and be brave I say get some balls and think for yourself and say what you think so that can't be allowed to happen because they don't want to fix the sickness of society because Society is sick instead what they want to do is get rid of the person who points it out we have all these problems and everyone's pretty much accepting it but when this guy reminds them it causes an issue we're not going to fix the problems get rid of him get that's why I have to go so sorry to interrupt you but the people in charge don't agree with anything I say the people in power you're right but they don't agree with any any normal person's point of view they don't give a [ __ ] about any of us when's the last time you've seen any of the people in power talk about inflation talk about the fact that the Border crisis the border is not closed Ed talk about rampant crime talk about the educational system being under attack no what do they talk about instead LGBT the climate crap no one cares about no one cares about this crap all they talk about is the crap no one cares about because that's the people who put them in power those with the money who are trying to purport these garbage agendas and all the things you do care about you're not allowed to mention if you mention them on a podcast like this you're going to end up in a jail cell take me to [ __ ] jail then top G take me to jail just I I don't know what the delay is let's go just do it yeah so but again I I keep kind of harping on that but it's like I'm so curious how or maybe you don't even think of it that way in terms of how you see you coming out the other side with the heat waned off or do you think do you think that's a possibility or do you think it's going to be like a fight till the death I think as this war ends another one will begin I think that life just morphs from one war to the next even if you think about the average person's life they think I'll be happy once I just get over this one thing or I'll be happy once this is done or I'll be happy once I bought this and it never works out like that as this war ends another war will begin life is constant a never- ending War you can either try your very best to have an easy life and be an unimportant nobody or you can get very good at having a hard life and at least matter as you suffer through the Human Experience and I don't see an ending because I don't think war is ever going to end the war will change perhaps perhaps it's not a Romanian Court perhaps it's something else but the war is going to go on forever and every single day I'm going to get up and do my best while I'm breathing and that's the reality I'm going to live for as long as they let me live until they decide that they don't want me around anymore and I would never kill myself and that's the bottom line and I I love that you say that too you always say I would never kill myself I wouldn't when I was in jail the first month I was in jail I think there was four suicides and I got really nervous that they were trying to set up a pattern mhm and I kept tweeting I would never kill myself never kill myself never kill I tweeted it near every other day so that's the one sop I don't want anyone to believe there's no circumstance on Earth in which I would kill myself ever I'm gonna you're going to have to kill me you're going to have to do it I'm not going to make it easy for them I'm not going to allow them to upset me take my ice cream away like a little girl boohoo and me do it for them no do your own dirty work unless well you were born in Washington DC right correct unless you run for president of the United States bro how many cases you got against him 100 I'm only dealing with like three I don't know bro 97 more well Trump's catching up I I I I am praying for the West because if he doesn't win I I think it's the end of end of America as we know it in a hypothetical Universe obviously this totally hypothetical but if you ran for president what were the first things if if president Tate was in office it's crazy that sounds What would it would be 20 years from now and I think the world will be a dramatically different place in 20 years but I do believe that the core tenants that Western leaders are lacking are a degree of nationalism a degree of care for their own people I think that would be refreshing to see wouldn't it be nice to see a president who cares about Americans over everyone else which is what Trump was I think nationalism and competence are probably the two things that you expect in the leader of a global power like America it's a shame that none of the current leaders have those two tenants but I think that a prioritization of your own people should be your primary objective in all things and regardless of how different the world is in 20 years from now or the geopolitical landscape my intention would be to serve the people who put me in power radical idea I know crazy but perhaps the people who vote for me and pay for the government that I'm in charge of should be the ones I'd be concerned about as opposed to everything and everyone else yeah I know C crazy I know but yeah it seems the people who are in charge are more interested in global money and and the global Finance which the people who put them there in the first place and obviously if you're Global Finance you have no particular concern for one geographical area or nation in fact if you're Global Finance you can benefit off the burning of a Nation off the destruction of a Nation there's no light without dark Global finances benefited off the exploitation of the second and third world for a very long time to enrich the first world and it can also benefit just as well off the destruction of the first world to enrich other parts of the the planet most people don't understand that people think they need to keep America alive because of the dollar and because it's America no they can live in Saudi or Tanzania they can live in a mansion anywhere and they have a globe master so they can fly anywhere they want and if America being decimated or destroyed will benefit them and make them forever profit they have no problem with that because they are globalist it's a different attitude I know what I'm talking about because I'm as rich as these [ __ ] and I'm telling you you get to a certain point where you can be anywhere and if your Allegiance isn't to a particular land let me put it this way there are very powerful people in the world today who you could say and they could be American Born American and you could say to them you will make forever profit but America will degrade at a rate of .2% every single year for the rest of your human life but you will make forever profit with your company and they will say yes and they'll think ah it'll be okay because all of the crime and all the degradation will hit areas they don't live in and cities they don't live in and neighborhoods they don't live in while they're in America if they're in America America at all and if you compound that across a bunch of people with power .2% .1% .3% n.4 all adds up and you start to realize why Society is being destroyed and why these people don't care because they don't experience it the average person experiences it and the average person is stuck with it because they can't move they don't have a private jet and they can't leave and they don't have Global money they have one job in one place and they are stuck there and those are the people who suffer and that's the reality and then these people get the people who were in charge into power to represent people but they don't represent the people they represent the global money and that's why they make the decisions they make and talk about the things they talk about and they'll talk about anything important trying and distract you keep you confused inflate the currency to zero but keep us arguing about whether men can get pregnant or not it's all a clown show it's all garbage Andrew points out the truth destroy him with the legal system now we're in a current predicament our current Quagmire if Andrew walks he becomes more powerful than ever before Romania is embarrassed decot is embarrassed FBI is embarrassed MSM is embarrassed said he's a human trafficker can't just lose the credibility of the BBC we need them to lie to people oh but he's innocent yeah but no he may be innocent but look at all this mess it causes yeah isn't it easier just to put him in jail if it bleeds it leads yeah if you beat this case and when you beat this case and you have the whole world support with you a lot of people where do you see yourself moving to it's another good question maybe I'll become a globalist maybe I live on a little boat take yach with my 11 wife wives settled down all my children some machine guns what would you call your yacht everybody has a name for their yacht what would you call yours the international Master which is not a girl's name but my father was an international master of Chess that's what I call it what would your pop say if he was still around today about where you're at right now I think part of him would laugh I don't think he'd be surprised son of a gun yeah like I knew it I don't think he'd be surprised at all he understood how the government and how the world works he'd be 0% surprised he'd certainly be proud of me um I know this sounds a bit crazy this was all meant to happen I I can't I can't explain it my father was telling me things from a very young age which made no sense until I was in jail perhaps this version of reality is existed before perhaps we in a simulation I'm not sure but I don't think he'd be 1% surprised if he came back to life for an hour and I told him what happened he'd be like yep duh anything new anything else yeah well Biden's president and that would be it like if if you're a man who tries his absolute best and is brutally competent and speaks against Authority there's only one path where else was this going to end where else does this end where else have people who have inspired Millions who spoke against Authority ever ended up besides jail or dead The Matrix is calling times up
