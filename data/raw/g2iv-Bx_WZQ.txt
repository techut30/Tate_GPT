how does one become a lady's manual well simple you know what and it's super simple I don't think there are any tricks and there are any hacks to it if you were to ask men the same question if you wanted to give a woman advice on how to get attention from all the high value men in the world the answer would be be a virtuous super beautiful 10 out of 10 high value women so I don't think it's a trick cuz I don't try to get women I feel like I try to become the best version of myself I can be and then women will naturally come to you and that's as simple as that and I know it sounds easy it's actually the hardest answer in the world cuz it's the answer no one wants to hear try to be the best version of yourself it's as simple as that work out in the gym read something learn something become interesting you know become wealthy of course cuz the wealth comes with a fun lifestyle women love fun yes that's why they like fast cars that's why they like when you take nice vacations cuz women love fun and when you're that guy you'll be surprised how easy it is if you're sitting there lonely if you're truly lonely and you can't get any women I can't teach you anything cuz if you had the basics you wouldn't be lonely it's not actually the outside perception you have I will walk around the city occasionally if I just finished training and sweatpants and you know sneakers or whatever and I know people know me but let's even talk three four years ago when maybe I wasn't so well known but I was still dressing very well in my in in my free time uh it's it's how you feel in and of yourself you know if I saw a beautiful woman sitting there at the mall sipping of coffee and I was dressed in you know my beard was all messy I had a hood up and I was in like sweatpants the confidence Ence you you haven't maximized your own confidence if if you know what I'm saying when when you're dressed really really well you just had a fresh haircut you know you feel like a different person so it's how it makes you feel first and foremost like you could do anything you put on a good suit it's the same reason I mean this and this is universal across human nature this isn't something specific to men it's exactly it's specific to women as well it's every single person in the world women will do their makeup and do their hair and put on a nice dress and then their personality you you'll know when you're hanging out with them seems different they're more full of their confidence they're more their natural self but definitely it's perception as well people take you more seriously people are more likely to stop and listen to what you have to say you know if you're dressed like a homeless person and you try and disturb someone when they're walking past you they think you want a dollar people are much more likely to listen what you have to say and also makes you more memorable also makes you more memorable a lot of guys don't dress up keep in mind cuz you go for a job interview you have to understand even if you just bought your basic kind of shirt from a store and some pants and some shoes and you think you're dressed nice that's like the standard issue job interview uniform you know the guy who's doing the job interview I know it's special to you I know you've prepared I know you think oh [ __ ] I really need to get this job he's seen 40 people today 50 people today who was the guy in the really nice suit that stands out you know so also s it burns you into people's minds and memories much more yeah when people say when people say the word Tristan T oh yeah he always wears nice suits and let me tell you something when you are dressed very well you aren't in a place you become the place you become part of the Ambiance of the place let's say you take the fanciers restaurant you could think of Imagine a very fancy restaurant right and you walk in there and everyone's in Beach shorts and Crocs and baseball t-shirts it ruins the Ambiance of the restaurants you're also doing your part to add to the Aesthetics of a nice location so if you go somewhere like Monaco to the casino you can't get in wearing a basball shirt and Crocs they won't let you in doesn't matter how much money you have but you go there dressed like me or I'd probably dress better than this if I went to the casino I'd be bow tied up and everything you I'm adding to the aesthetic of the place by just being a man in a $330,000 tuo standing by the bar spping drinks I'm adding to the place whereas if you go somewhere looking for a bum like looking like a bum you're subtracting from the Aesthetics of a beautiful place and you can get a really you can get a good suit for3 four $500 if you go a Hugo Boss or something but you can get much cheaper than that and if it fits you well and you're in decent shape and if and if you're in decent shape that's the key if you if you work it's like t-shirts it's like t-shirts you wear a plain black T-shirt and you're in good shape versus wearing a Versace t-shirt that cost 900 bucks but you're fat as [ __ ] but you know what's the most important yeah don't be geek it's the man inside the suit it's the man inside the suit you give me a t-shirt and shorts and you put some of these dorks who hate on me in a $25,000 suit and watch who gets the women watch who gets the business contract watch who will pass any job interview me in my shorts so rule number one don't be a geek women are always interested in learning new stuff women are always interested in hearing new things that they find interesting and it always depends on the vehicle of delivery yes you know it's the vehicle of delivery if if you're a little nerd who be like oh well women should like me I know lots of stuff I read lots of books yeah but you're a little dork with a pencil neck women aren't interested in even sitting down next to you let alone listening to anything that comes out of your mouth if they think I might want to sleep with this guy cuz you have to understand before dates before dates especially when it's your third fourth fifth date the decision to sleep with you go to bed with you give you what you're after is already made usually by women before you go so you just have to go out and freestyle it if you're sitting there saying interesting stuff that she doesn't know will she remember it no will she talk about it with her friends no but they find things they don't know incredibly interesting so yeah become an interesting guy when you're not looking for something serious which none of you young people really should be have fun and when you're trying to have fun don't ask what you don't want to know like girls lie and girls aren't honest so if you're 21 the girl you're dating or the girls you're trying to hook up with or whatever aren't probably going to be the girls that you marry yeah you know if you meet a girl and you think oh this is suspicious why is her handbag so expensive blah blah maybe just hang out eat dinner with with her have fun with her and when it when it ends it ends maybe don't try to be hey what are you actually really doing you're 21 shut up once she doesn't have to explain herself to you but two you're not in the position where you can offer something so serious it's only when you finally establish yourself and you're looking for those girls that you perhaps you know want to settle down with want to get married with want to start a family with well you need to be analyzing her past so that's a game to play for the older dudes I feel rather than you youngsters a lot of guys are like 19 oh how do I find a good girl maybe maybe just you know become a millionaire and find one when you're 28 maybe maybe just shut the [ __ ] up about finding a good girl if she'll sleep with you when you're 19 maybe that's good enough for now I think the the simple advice is accountability and self-reflection what I would like you to do after watching this wonderful show go to your bedroom take off your shirt strip down to your underwear look at yourself in the mirror pause speak to yourself for 10 minutes think if I didn't have this nice house and I wasn't stood here in this particular house with the Lamborghini outside and I wasn't this Rich what about me would women want and if the answer is nothing then you're only going to attract the women who are into your money and your money only because I've got loads of money and I understand that women enjoy my company they like being around me they like listening to me so if you have nothing but money then that's what you're going to get the girls who are after your money you have to up your game in every single way and stop throwing the money around and then you'll meet the M the girls who like you because you're strong and fit who like you because you're smart who like you because you're charming who like you because you dress well who like you because I don't know maybe you you have you have class you have etiquette you have Poise you take them to things that they don't know you take them to the Opera instead of this club you'll find those special girls when you are a man that those kind of girls will want but let me tell you something most women I know are smarter than the millionaire streamers the the clowns who who talk nonsense and and do [ __ ] most women I know are smarter so you take someone smarter than you who's after your money she's going to get it you know what I'm actually quite a good specimen of man I'm good looking enough I'm strong enough I'm fit enough I'm interesting enough yeah I can see why women like me if you can genuinely reflect in that way and you're honest to yourself and you're right then you should be meeting good women so of course they get the girls who are just after their money I don't blame the girls everyone's going to complain about gold diggers you're a skinny little pencil neck dweed with nothing interesting to say you're not manly you're not physically attractive you don't speak well what else should they want what else should they want they don't feel protected around you they don't feel safe with you of course they want the money it honestly doesn't bother me like it bothers you because I think this is a dog eat dog world and I think if you're going to make yourself a Target because the answer to their problem they think the answer to their problem is more clout more money I don't know maybe the good girl's going to come along the answer to their problem is three years of hard work that they're not going to do they're not going to do it and they know that's the answer they know that's the answer three years of hard work is the answer to their problem but they're not going to do it so am I going to get mad at the uh at the lion for picking on the weakest gazelle n I'm not cuz that's the way the world is you know I think the younger men should be seeing this being like Oh we got finessed by this girl okay cool and if they run into some money they should be able to see you can learn from Bad examples just as much as you can learn from good examples so the bad examples are out there for a reason and it doesn't upset me to see it upsets me when I've had friends who are really great guys really hardworking dudes try the BET to be the best version of them themselves who've gone through bad divorces who've gone through bad breakups and yeah that's sad and it's sad to see women take advantage of of men who are actually trying their best but if you want to be the lame gazelle walking around with a limp the Lion's going to eat you I I don't actually feel sorry for them and I don't care cuz they know the answer to the problem everyone knows the rules to the game already everybody knows that if you wake up and you're lazy and you sit around on your phone you scroll on Tik Tok for four or five hours you go to work at your normal job you work your shift when there's nothing wrong with hard work and there's there's there's nobility in in working any job and then you go home and you do nothing and you watch TV you know you're not going to make it it's not actually something that I need to tell anybody and they do this to me on on super chats all the time and they do this to Andrew specifically because Andrew is a more accomplished fighter than me they be like hey Andrew give me some advice on how to be a good kickboxer is there a gym near your house why aren't you there right now why weren't you there yesterday everyone already knows the answers and they search unfortunately for for cheat codes for magic words that I'm going to tell you that are going to make you rich you have to out compete everybody else because there are only so many although dollars can be printed in an unlimited amount there's only so much wealth in the world there are only so many Lamborghinis that are built every year there are only so many mansions in every single country there are only so many private jets and so many beautiful women and so much gasoline and Fuel and food and caviar and all the crap that everyone wants and there's only so much gold and so many protects and so many Rolexes that are made you have to out compete other people to get the things that you want you know us I am glued to my laptop and phone all I do is work and all Andrew does is work so the fact that we we've shown such amazing results coming from where we're come from there's no magic spell there's no Hocus Pocus i' go back to my younger self and I'd say yeah keep it up cuz you're definitely going to make it because that young guy who was broke is now me oh the worst advice is great the worst advice exists everywhere in the universe and you hear it all the time the worst advice I don't know if the people in charge of the world put this out here on purpose but you see it every single day some flowers take longer to bloom don't worry you're time will come if you're not where you want to be today don't worry it's going to happen your time's going to come your ship's going to come in that's the worst sh I've ever seen and it's on the internet every day you're going to start seeing it now you're going to start seeing it's on the internet everywhere you just scroll past it you haven't taken in the [ __ ] just F bro it's it's terrible and for any young person to sit there whose life isn't going right who had a failed relationship they're 21 working a dead end job but to see on the internet don't worry some flowers take longer to bloom you're going to make it one day your time will come and go okay great sigh of relief my time will come the internet said so if you buy into that you deserve to be poor forever like panic mode is the best mode to be in things aren't quite right life sucks my girlfriend just left me can't pay my rent panic mode [ __ ] the internet [ __ ] some flowers take longer to bloom [ __ ] my time is going to come panic panic and succeed that's the worst advice I've ever seen happiness is the purpose of life but not for yourself let me make sure that my children are happy let me make sure my mother is Happy let me make sure any woman who comes into my life is Happy let me even because men don't have each other's backs these days make my friends my male friends as happy as I can but nothing about my quest for happiness is about I guess personal happiness I do the things I like to do I like to drive fast cars I do these things because they entertain me but I don't wake up every day trying to be happy so I don't think happiness is the purpose of life for men I think men should be trying to make everyone else happy it's very ironic actually that they'll call old-fashioned men like me who want to provide for their women and not maybe have their woman have a job and provide for his family in the traditional way they'll say like oh you just want your woman to be a slave for you okay she might make a few sandwiches okay she might cook a few meals you might change a few diapers but if I'm working 18 hour days 7 days a week I am the slave I serve people that's what I do the people in my life I serve them and by exchange you know you they serve you back you know your daughter can make you happy your wife can make you happy girlfriend mother they can make you happy too and just seeing the smiles on their faces is often enough for men success is a form of Revenge success is the best form of Revenge I don't believe in getting revenge on anybody I've had people screw me over for money break my heart upset me yeah but I don't do it for the Revenge it just naturally happens being being angry at someone is like holding a burning Stone in your hand with the intention of throwing at them like it might do them some damage but it will do you more damage first I don't hold on to these I didn't need fuel to to go and make something of myself it's just naturally happened as a form of Revenge but success is a form of Revenge I think it's the only form of Revenge
