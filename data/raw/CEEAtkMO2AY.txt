I like Andrew Tate. So Andrew Tate of India. Yeah. What does he say? He says that. Okay. So he says it from a guy's point of view that you know men are supposed to do all this. I think even women are supposed to do all that. You know I think that you're supposed to escape the matrix. Even if you're a girl, you're supposed to escape the matrix. You can't just wait for a guy to take you on a private jet. You're supposed to do that yourself. Ah. Are you going to find a good man in your life? I don't want a man in my life. Wait, are you a boyfriend? No. No. Friends, friend, friends, friends. Oh, you don't want a man? No. What if you found the perfect guy? I want to be the female version of Andrew Tate. Not Andrew Tate's girlfriend. Really? Okay.
