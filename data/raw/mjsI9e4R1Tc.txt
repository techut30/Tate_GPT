mind if I sit down oh Andrew how you been how are you yeah I'm I'm doing all right I'm doing all right what brings you what brings you to this part of town well trying to escape the madness you know sometimes you're just trying to find a little piece in this world I think that's what we're all looking for isn't it I don't know about you but if I read the newspaper nowadays I get pretty anxious I start to feel genuinely concerned if I read the news well you know you're the perfect guy to ask this is there anything ever good in this paper in the news in general I ask what the point in the news is is the point of the news to inform us all or is the point of the news to just try and make us accept their lives for a little bit longer right I think they're trying to placate such a large portion of the population so they can just steal the human energy energy and the finances of people and I don't know I I don't know if there was any good news to tell they'd even tell us you know I never thought that I would see the day when things could be worse than when they were in my life but when in my life my former life I enjoyed it when they were bad we took advantage of it yeah but now seeing it from a different side me this I I can't even believe how out of control everything has got the most basic things are broken family's broken man woman child is broken what is a man what is a woman everything's so subjective now there's no objective truths left and they're just setting that up so that we'll accept anything and everything and they're trying to get us to the point where we have no barriers left in our mind for the slave programming we can't even say what a man is what a woman is that you're supposed to have children that a man's supposed to protect and provide for the woman you can't say anything basic so they can come along with a brand new version of reality inject it into our minds and uh I'm sure it's designed to benefit them not us and the slavery continues and I feel like especially this year I said at the beginning of the year I said this is a pivotal year for the world they have so many elections going on in so many large countries and obviously we have the American election which is a really big one and I don't know if the people at home realize especially the people who say oh I don't follow politics and it's no big deal I don't know if they realize that this is probably one of the last years we stand a chance to do anything about this I feel like time is running out and once they have it all locked down the way they intend on locking it all down it's going to be a lot harder to even voice your concerns let Lo do much else so scary times Well I can tell you this this election is certainly the most important in my lifetime and I think if this goes the wrong way in my opinion the wrong way is kamla Harris uh America's done well how can it yeah how can it recover right I mean isn't the point of a leader that they're supposed to stick up and fight for you that's what's so amazing to me that there's enough people inside of the country there's enough of the population who will sit there and believe that she actually cares enough to fight for their interests she hasn't even said a single thing she's going to do for anybody it's remarkable but how did how did people become so ignorant I mean look I'm a lot older than you you know I grew up in the 50s 60s 7s people were not this ignorant they saw through things I mean this woman is is a facade yep Y and they're not seeing it are they not seeing it or are they just so caught up you know the truth is the truth and you're supposed to accept the truth irregardless of how it makes you feel but now we have a world so obsessed with feelings and that's why they pushed this emotionality and they push feminism and they push the idea of feminizing men because you have a subsect of the population who will look at something they will see the truth but if they don't like how the truth makes them feel they won't accept it their feelings supersede truth so they can look and say ah camela does not have a track record of success she's yet to say what she's going to do as the leader she can't argue with world leaders on behalf of America like Trump could she doesn't have the experience they'll ignore all that they want to believe because she's a woman or whatever other reason that she's better so their truth changes truth in of itself 2 plus 2 equals 4 but to some people they feel better if it equals five and they'll ignore the truth and it's really crazy that if you talk to these people the conversation won't even be about objective truths it'll just be about but she's a girl and this is where We've Ended up I how do you argue with that I mean she is a girl yeah yeah but my gosh I mean these are the same people that are suffering through what this Administration has caused for the past three and a half years and they want more of the same I I don't you know I I just cannot I I sit down at night and I I think I how could they do I cannot I can't process it where do you think it's all going to end up if Trump does win what do you think is going to happen you know I mean if he wins he's going to have another battle for the next four years trying to set things straight again um you know they're going to come after him and every which I think they may even try to assassinate this guy they hate him that much they hate him that much but is he going to be able to get anything done I think so I think he will you know some people have said there's going to be a revolution that he's hated so much that people are not going to be able to accept him in office I think it might be the other way around you know on on Rumble lately I know you were on that platform yeah if you see the people are so angry yeah the messages that they're angry there's hatred coming out in all the responses and the comments I don't know I think if he doesn't win we're going to see we're going to see some real problems that's that's my feeling cigar yeah why not well I think people feel like if he doesn't win there's no longer a political solution right I think so and the the goal is the goal is for politics to avoid violence that's the whole point of politics in the first place the whole point of a election is to avoid the need for a war when the leader dies or the leader changes there's usually a war to find out who the new leader is but that's expensive and it causes a lot of Carnage so you have politics instead and people are prepared to accept the loss if they believe it's fair MH but now people understand it's not fair anymore especially if Trump loses they're going to understand it's not fair and they're going to realize there's no political solution to their problems and when there's no political solution there's only ever one other solution and then we have two very unfortunate scenarios if he loses we have a large swath of the population who understand that it was rigged and it was set up and that there's no political solution and they quietly March into slavery or America Burns and they're both bad you know because I mean every likes the idea of civil unrest and Everyone likes the Glamorous idea of chaos but when you have thousands of men outside your door and the police aren't answering the phone doesn't matter what side of the equation you're on you don't want to be in that scenario right exactly even if they're on your team Crowds Are chaotic and things happen nobody wants that so but then what do you do you march step into slavery you just agree that there's no political solution and they can rig it and set it all up and you're just going to sit there and accept it it's pretty scary and I'd like to believe that we still have a chance just to get people to think and use their minds enough and quietly peacefully resist this garbage enough to stop them actually getting the lock on the door you know it's an Empire of Lies I I often whenever I consume the MSM or I read the news I struggle to find anything that's not a lie yeah it's all a lie absolutely it's an Empire of Lies the history of how this Empire came to be is a Lie the current situation we're in is a lie their plans for the future are a lie the people who were supposed to trust lie so with enough truth and enough people simply not believing their lies I'd like to believe that's enough to prevent Humanity being basically enslaved but we're getting close to the wire now friend because I still feel like there's such a huge percentage of people people who just don't seem that interested they just seem to want to let it go on as it is and and these people I guess they don't realize that they're aiding the enemy to sit there and say I don't care and I'm I'm not political I'm not that interested well that means you're leaving up to the very few Freedom Fighters and you're just walking along with whatever the satanists want you to do you're not on you're on their side you're helping them a lot more than they realize well let me ask you you think people are just ignorant today that they can't can't see the truth um I mean I know I don't know if there's any correlation but there must be I know our education system is in trouble in the United States people are not literate like they used to be are they not seeing you know again what's the definition of insanity doing the same thing over and over again expecting a different result well putting this person back in office yeah is the same result as they're going through now and they're experiencing hardship you haven't been back there in a while but it's it's bad in the United States I mean this inflation thing is is hurting everybody there's crime running rampant in the streets I mean it's it's crazy and these people look at it and they think that she's some kind of Savior not knowing anything about her that she's done that that's good nothing and and she's currently in power right the person in power is promising that when she's in power she'll fix problems that she hasn't fixed and won't fix exactly and not only that you have a media now that for some reason this is what I came understand cuz these are educated people they're educated people they're trying to reinvent her and everything that was done wrong or that she didn't do it that she didn't accomplish they're putting a smoke screen over that and making her out to be like this icon now what's their motive these people all right they got money they don't suffer like the rest of the people on the street they have money but they also have to realize you know we got a very serious we have very serious enemies in the United States yeah and this woman is absolutely I mean the the idea of her sitting with a Putin or sitting with Chi or or you know anybody from Iran I'm not sure they'd even take the meeting no I don't think they'd even sit there with why would they yeah it's a joke they wouldn't even they wouldn't even regard her yeah and this is serious stuff I mean the United States we're in trouble there we have a you know $ 35 trillion debt that you can't get out from under I don't care what anybody says there's no way to get out from under a debt like that where it's going to lead who knows but you don't get out of that so you got 34 trillion $35 trillion debt you got people that are now taking advantage of us in China and Russia you got Wars happening all over the world that nobody can stop in a current Administration and this is real Ser I'll be honest I'm worried about my my kids my grandkids I don't care about myself I'm 73 years old what are you going to do to me but my family I mean this is frightening stuff it really is certainly is because if America Falls where do you go right I mean you have the choice of staying and being a patriot doing your very best to defend it but even if you decided you had to leave you go where people don't realize the world is very tribal like you can leave America you can go to Russia but you're not Russian and you never will be Russian no how am I going to live there I can't and and most and most of the world operates that way right people in America were very open to the idea that someone can come in and be there a while and be American it doesn't work that way in most places in the world right you're always going to be a foreigner you're always going to be a second class citizen to some degree in the eyes of the law and the you know this better than anyone I mean if you're wealthy and wellknown and famous and you're in the wrong country the gangsters also want to pay that that's the that's the world right% so we're on a we're on a ship and there really isn't a Lifeboat when you look at the idea of Western ideals and Western democracies and America supposed to set an example I mean what's the chance of any election on the planet ever being fair again if everybody knows America reason it's over for the whole idea of democracy now listen I know for a fact the last election wasn't fair was it was it rigged enough to ear it you know in Biden's favor I don't know but I know there was certainly a lot of stuff going on you know I have PE people and friends in uh in Pennsylvania in Arizona and they were telling me things that were happening so I mean that's another worry you know is this election is it going to be fair I don't think so these people Andrew these I'm going to tell you this these are the worst people in the world government is the most corrupt organization on the planet and unfortunately it's gotten to the United States at this point I I look I witnessed this throughout my time on the street you know we had plenty of politicians that we worked with what do politicians want they want money and they want votes if you provide both they'll do what you want many of them not all of them but many of them but it's gotten to a point now where they they don't even hide anything they don't even care anymore I mean they they go in there you know making uh $150,000 a year and they come out worth millions of dollars and they do it right in front of everybody and they tell you yeah they tell you it's it's it's interesting because people don't seem to understand that the politicians and the police and the judges and the doctors all of these people are as fallible and morally repugnant as the average man on the street because abely because they are the average man on the street if I were to say to you do you want this average man on the street in charge of your life you'd say no I don't know who is he I don't trust him absolutely not but then you trust these this group of clowns expecting them to be somehow better like they're superhuman yeah they're human too they have their own biases they have their own motivations they're corruptible absolutely and it's very rare to meet somebody who's prepared to put their neck on the line for what they believe is right especially for somebody else who they don't particularly know you know if you were to get 20 federal agents in a room and 19 of them are intent on setting this guy up and one of them doesn't really want to set the guy up but you know does he really want to piss off and lose his career and who is this guy anyway maybe he's an [ __ ] and he did something in the past he may not have done this he did it in the past and takes a very special kind of person to stand up and really try and make a fuss absolutely most people just kind of go with the flow and this is where we get back into the point I made earlier you do a lot of damage by just going with the flow right yes because we're now in a battle for Humanity and it's not a matter of you can't sit this fight out you're either on the good team or you're going along with what the bad team want you to do which is to stay asleep keep your eyes half closed pretend you don't notice oh maybe the election's fair maybe it is fair maybe last time it was fair maybe camela would be all right we'll see how it works out truthfully it's cowardice people are afraid to accept the realities because then they're imployed to act so by pretending everything's fine they don't have any obligation to do anything so they can just sit there and go ah it'll all work out I'm not really into politics oh you're not into politics you're not into the leaders of your country you're not into to the taxes you pay you're not into the global Wars destroying children all around the planet you're not into that what are you into TV do you listen to music oh that's very interesting like I've heard people say I'm not political how are in the world we're currently in life and death how are you not political they're trying to take your children and brainwash them and you're not political you're exactly right there was somebody yesterday younger guy you know he was had a uh a commo rally and they said what are you doing here you know they started to ask him about her politics he said well I'm not really interested in politics I'm just here for the vibe and I look at that and I say this guy his vote is going to have a a an impact on my life my wife my kids I I just it drives me crazy I mean I'm trying I don't know if it's old age or I don't know what it is but man I you're right and this is where we need some kind of conscientious conscientious objection regarding all of the competent people of the planet like if I saw that video right and I voted for Trump and I was in the military and camela won and I was sent to go die somewhere I'd say nope no would no why I'm not going to die based on the policy of this president who was voted in on a Vibe I I'd rather go to jail I'm done I I totally agree with you and it's actually a shame because I remember when they got do you remember when they got that black basketball player out of Russian jail and at the time there's a a white spy who's been sitting in Russian jail for nine years and she hated America oh she hated America but when they got her out they were talking in the press conference she's a person of color and she's LGBT all they talked about is that she's black and gay and how important it was to get her out if you're a straight white male why are you even working for the government anymore they will leave you in jail to [ __ ] raw ABS they will leave you in jail to Raw because you're the wrong and the wrong sexual orientation why are you even going to work it's Insanity to me and until the competent people stand up and say enough is enough I'm not advocating for violence I'm advocating for the absolute opposite I'm advocating for a lack of action in many ways come do this you know what no because I don't feel respected in this country anymore and I feel like this has just become identity pols politics garbage 100% And I've had enough until that happens they're going to continue to push the buck down the road I mean you know from your life better than even I know but if somebody keeps pushing and you never push back they're going to push as far as they can go and and they've been absolutely doing that and then they come after somebody like you because you speak your mind you speak the truth and you get penalized for it indied for it yeah thrown in jail for it AB absolutely your ability to speak freely is directly correlated to your insignificance you can speak as much as you want if nobody listens people start listening and then you start talking little problems start to appear in this Free Nation this free Empire we live within and uh it's a scary place but they can't do that to everybody so you have to inspire bravery in people right you have to try and make people understand that time is running out and that they have to finally choose a side and if you choose a side of evil then you're on the side of evil and if you choose the side of good then you're going to do your very best to see the truth and tell the truth irregardless of how anyone feels about the truth but if you're going to sit there and pretend you're not playing the game like most people do you're actually doing exactly what the bad team want you're aiding them you know a lot of these words they come up with because I've been called them all quite proud of that so have I yeah yeah racist homophobic misogynistic you name I got I got every badge so have I if you have basic pattern recognition skills and you're a realist you're going to come to the odd conclusion which they can deem one of these things I mean that's just how it is I wouldn't leave my child with gay men right homophobe right I believe a man is calmer Under Pressure than a woman ah misogynist like they'll come at you with all these words and the primary objective of these words is to make you too scared to accept the truth you see they want you to look at data use your mind use basic pattern recognition to come to a conclusion then throw that conclusion away because they'll label you right and go back to the conclusions they want you to have which is inside of their empire of lies in all clown world and it's kind of scary that they have so much so many people of the population who will play that game because they're scared of being the bad guy did you ever you're you're 100% right did you ever think that you would see so much dishonesty and hypocrisy at such a high level I mean I feel like and maybe this is me being optimistic governments always make mistakes and governments aren't perfect but I feel like at least maybe in the 80s and 90s that the big Stakes or the big things America were doing was at least good for the American Empire as a whole I guess and at least enriching the country as a whole I guess you know so even if they did heinous things all around the world at least America got richer and the population got richer at least there was some light to the dark I feel like currently now there's not even any upside to any of the things they're doing besides for this transnational Elite which probably aren't even American half of them who just bounce in and out all around the world anyway it's no no longer even about America what they're doing they're just using America like a [ __ ] because it has the military and it has the dollar to extract wealth for themselves and raping the tax base and they don't care what happens to America they have no interest at all what happens to America they're going to use it till it explodes and they're going to let it burn and they're going to jump on a private jet and leave and the amount of dishonesty and the amount the amount of Lies We are constantly told I don't know how many times your government and the media need to lie to you before you wake up well that's the thing you know today everything is on video and they lie and they and you can see it Trump fell over did you know Trump fell over he fell over oh it said it said in it said in the paper that at his rally in Pennsylvania he wasn't shot at he fell down oh yeah no I I heard that well they they they said it then they got rid of it because yeah he fell over I mean what he they shot at the guy yes bro on it comes up bleeding and they're saying it was an act and and oh my God I I couldn't even believe that fortunately like I said they said it and then they got rid of it the same day that was like too was too crazy for even for them to put out there but you know I I just cannot understand the level these people don't have there's no Integrity anymore they don't care they lie you know when Biden uh stepped down or was pushed out by Nancy Pelosi and the crew back there who I got to tell you they're more devious and than any mobster I ever knew you know honestly mean and and with all due respect they probably make more money oh no question no question no question but you know I have no empathy for him whatsoever because I think that guy for 50 years has been living off taxpayer money hasn't done anything the guy is a is a pathological liar no doubt about it but the idea that um this is one of their own that they stabbed in the back so quickly and yet care so little about this country that they you know why they're keeping him in office now I'll tell you why because they don't want KLA Harris to own anything if if he would to resign or they get him out and she takes over now for the next three or four months everything is on her yeah now she can say oh this is Biden it wasn't me oh that's right and also we'll say to her well all your campaign promises do them exactly oh well well she ain't going to do those because they're all a lie so then she'll be in a position where she has to do them you know what I found interesting is everyone was saying Joe Biden is so competent Joe Biden is perfect Joe Biden can do everything he's great then he had one interview one debate with Trump and then instantly every single liberal in lock deck turned on him yeah oh I can't believe maybe he's not competent you knew that you lied for three and a half years why why did you on who gave you the memo on this day where you're allowed to point out the obvious and pretended you didn't see it before that lied for three and a half years and then one day every all all at once they were allowed to now say ah he's incompetent as if they didn't know like the most disingenuous garbage as soon as the donor money as soon as the donor said no more money that was it everything's about money but let me ask you this and this is this is a normal conversation to have with anybody you have a best friend you have a business partner he lies to you once yeah all right well you know mistakes happen he lies to you a second time hey what's going on here all right you give him a pass a third time a fourth time hey I'm done yeah how often how much longer can you stay with somebody that's dishonest with you all the time and these people have been dishonest for three and a half years and yet people are willing to give them another shot you know and I've been telling people you don't do that these people are never going to be honest with you they're always going to be disingenuous and it's not only that they're being dishonest they're hurting you in the in the in the whole process Y and they still can't see it and I I'm saying to myself either they're so brainwashed or like you said or they're so ignorant they're ignorant to a point where they can't see it right in front of their face and they're willing to take you know whatever suffering you're going to have over the next couple of years because I there's no question they want to destroy the middle class they don't want any middle class so it was already dying yeah right I mean I was talking to one of my friends in England the other day and I was saying that America doesn't manufacture much but it makes some things yeah uh it doesn't grow all its food but it grows some stuff but we were talking about England I said England doesn't build a thing it doesn't grow anything it's all just Banking and insurance and city of London and numbers and fagi right and I said the way you make money in England is for money money makes money you buy property or you buy stocks or you buy bonds or Venture capitalism money makes money which is great for the rich the rich get richer but if you don't have any money to begin with how you going to make any money you can't I don't think most people realize that America is considerably richer than even England England is a very poor country with it has a lot of rich people in it dotted around but in general it's a very poor country the average life for the average low-income worker in England is terrible MH and there's no chance of ever getting out ever and if you voice your concerns about these things well then you go to jail because there's no free speech now you can't tweet about it you can't put it on Facebook you can't mention any of these things you can't talk about it so you just have to sit there and slowly die I guess I mean America still has at least free speech to a degree at least some semblance of social Mobility but how long will that last with a wide open border a terrible Economic Policy endless money printing an Elite Class of politicians who are interested primarily in how much they can steal you know I don't think many people really understand how detrimental and destructive corruption is to a government because that's what destroys all these poor African and South American countries is corruption you can't run a business with corruption imagine had a normal business and you buy the water for a dollar and you sell it for $2 but the guy who drops the water off wants 10 cents and then your shopkeeper when he takes it in he wants 10 cents and then the guy who Rings it up wants another 10 cents and the guy who brings the plastic bags he wants 10 cents for himself by the time you sell that water no money's made y because everybody mob stuff everybody's stealing everybody's stealing but the mob they don't care because they'll steal it blind and it'll collapse and they'll move on to the next project that's it so maybe we have like you put in your book Mafia democracy maybe we have mob in charge of America Now who are just trying to steal and rape as much as they can to let it burn because I don't think many people understand when you talk about globalists Alex Jones these people talk about globalists they're like okay well what is a globalist well I'll explain very simply what a globalist is a globalist is the kind of person who is not linked to any geographical area he can go anywhere in the world he has enough friends and enough money to be anywhere and he'll make decisions for his profits which detriment a specific geographical area so like you have a man who will cut down the trees in the rainforest for his profit but he doesn't live in the rainforest so he doesn't care it's exactly the same if you look at America now the people who want all these migrants to turn up and work low paid basically no paid jobs I mean I understand if you're a billionaire and you have a factory and you want people to turn up with no health insurance and they're going to come and they're going to work and the job's going to get done and you're going to make more profit that's fine but how does that affect the community well he doesn't live in the community right so he doesn't care so America's just got to the point now where everyone is trying to protect their profits as opposed to protect the country and the country is being exploited and one day it's going to all blow up and when it blows up all of these people will be found somewhere else and that's the very unfortunate reality of it we need to build something or bring something back and this is what Trump's so amazing at is putting America First genuinely America First over everything else and it's a race and they're starting to catch up with us you know have you ever thought about this I mean you probably know better than me but do you think once China's in charge they're gonna be nice to us absolutely not you think you think we're going to ever have a chance to get first place back never or do you think they're going to crush us ruthlessly it's over at that point you know I got to go into something this hatred that people have with Trump now you know people are you're a trump lover I said I'm not a trump lover you know there's a famous uh you know Bill Parcels famous coach he said something once when they were giving him all these uh you know adoli for the team for the Giants and he looked at me he said you are what your record tells you you are that's it don't say we're better don't say we're worse we are what our record tells us we are so I look at Trump and I have no relationship with Trump you know he he's a guy that for three and a for four years did a good job for the country everybody knows it everybody was living better I have I have no horse in this race other than to see that that happen again and that's why I look at Trump but this hatred that people I've never witnessed anything like that and the only answer for that is that he just didn't go along with the swamp as he calls as we all know it he didn't go along with and they hated him for it to a point where they're they were ready to kill this guy I've never seen such venom for any any one person in politics that's done nothing you know and every label they've put on him has been false as far as everything they've accused him of the two impeachments the whole mother investigation everybody it was all a lie and they continue but I think the common average idiot liberal who you see who so so the the dislike they have for him is truly venomous it's truly venomous it is I don't know sometimes you look and you just see a rabbit dislikes A fox just because the fox is capable and the rabbit really isn't in that situation I don't know if these people are just so helpless this learned helplessness this this constant to a degree self-loathing or loathing of other people these people are not happy they're not balanced I don't think these people are even interested in success these people can't even get out of bed and try and make their house look presentable how can you trust these people to choose someone to make a country presentable I think these country are these people are just broken people who are genuinely sad in and of themselves and are so filled with hate and vital they've been pointed and directed at Trump by The Matrix itself and they just want somebody to attack I I really believe these people are just sad broken people and even if you were to sit down with them and spend hours explaining that the country will be better if Trump wins they don't want that they don't want it to be better they don't want it to be better they don't want the world to be better they don't want life to be better they just want to somehow win some ideological argument or they want their pathetic worldview validated what do we say about truth the world will be better if Trump wins that is the truth here is the math 2 plus 2 equals 4 ah but if the other team wins I'll feel better because I don't like Trump for XY Z or because Camala said something once I listened to two years ago so I want 2 plus 2 to equal 5 the world will not be better if Trump wins it'll be better if Cala wins because of some subjective absolute garbage these people have lost a grip on reality they've lost a grip on reality you know I've never studied Democratic systems probably something I I should do but I feel like if it was taxpaying males mhm all these problems would go away you know people who pay into the system yeah people who vote for the leader who gets to decide if he sends them to die in a war that would fix most of it right yeah but we have this insane system now especially in America where supposedly anyone can vote without ID which completely undermines the legitimacy of any election anyway I don't even understand that I mean 198 Democrats voted for uh no ID to register to vote it it's insan so what is a vote so what is a vote just who can get the most pieces of paper in a box now that that's the vote who can get the most pieces of paper in a box absolutely and I mean in Venezuela I I'm no I'm no expert on Venezuelan politics but someone asked me after the Venezuelan election in Maduro won they said do you think Maduro cheated they're accusing him of cheating and I said you want me to be honest with you I've been around long enough to know that both sides were cheating it's Venezuela both sides cheated but at least when both sides cheat you have a competence test of who's a better cheater at least you have some degree of competition exactly but America now we have one team cheating yeah the other team letting them cheat as long as they can steal along beside them and pretend to be against them yeah and then you seem to have one man coming along trying to fix it all surrounded by snakes and traitors it seems bro Trump's doing God's work he's a very brave man doing God's work trying to save the country he loves because he understands once America Falls the entire world is going to be different America is an individualistic country it's based on individual exceptionalism China's a collectivist country right it's China once they're in charge it's about the ant farm it's not about the ant MH and you're going to be living in a society where you'll be expected to sacrifice yourself for the good of the ant farm that's how they work I speaking to somebody else you know a little bit about this you know a little bit about jail but since I got out of jail I've been researching legal system CU I've been enjoying the Romanian legal system and all of it's garbage yeah exactly exactly God sorry about that when you say enjoying damn it exactly so cut that out guys so I've been enjoying the remaining legal system so I've been looking up other legal systems yeah and there's a attitude typically in the west about innocent till proven guilty and individualism and that person must be proven guilty there's a lot of legal systems where the sanctity of the state and the idea that the state doesn't make mistakes is more important than an individual liberty there are legal systems where they say Japan which is a first world nation is our Ally they have a 98% conviction rate you go to court in Japan you go to jail done and the goal there is they're saying making the state look like they got something wrong would do more damage to society than we can accept so innocent people sometimes just go to jail that's just how they view it that's a collectivist mindset and that's what China's like that's what a lot of these countries are like when we lose American individualism that's what's going to come which brings us further down the slave programming and I'll tell you who they'll come for first the people who talk I mean that's who they're going to come for first they're going to come for anyone who sticks their head up they're already doing that they're just trying to get rid of anyone who speaks about the symptoms as opposed to fix any diseases because the disease is contingent and important for them to be able to continue to steal and that's all they want to do is just Rob and it feels like America is just getting used while they I mean I don't have any proof of this but the Middle East is getting more powerful certain countries in Africa certain countries in South America the global South the second world nations are getting more and more and more powerful I feel like they're just going to rape America till it burns and just try and make someone else in charge do you think it's time for America to fall well Empires don't last forever but there's always some indicators right I mean there are very few Empires throughout history there's been some who were destroyed primarily and only because of outside influence man you know this better than me I bet if you had a mob with no treason no treachery no snakes no backstabbing no rats even the cops couldn't get in absolutely it takes one it takes Insidious it's the Insidious betrayal of cowards that destroys anything mhm and now look at what we have in America there are people who hate America in America who want to see America burn or at least change it so drastically it's not America anymore and these are the people that are going to destroy America much more before China or Russia or Iran do it's going to be the people inside of the nation that's what's going to happen and it's going to be it's going to fall in real time well immorality which is rampant in our country a weakened Min uh um what does I say weakened military I'm sorry and financial issues and we've got them all well how do you convince people to fight if they don't get a vote I mean I mean surely that's the bare contingent to tell men to go die in a ditch that you get to come back and vote you go to fight in Afghanistan for four five six years you come home vote they rig it I mean I love America and I love the west but even I can't with good conscience tell anyone to go die in that military now for what especially when you're not even defending the shores of your country I understand why the Russians are signing up and why Putin has no problem finding soldiers they're fighting on the border of Russia for Russian sovereignty right we're sending our people to die for banks God knows where and Tristan made a good point he said you know people that have fought in a war should have two or three votes they risked it all they risk their lives which there's nothing more important than that you know and people but they want to put people that just walked into the the country to vote that have no say whatsoever no sweat in the game nothing and it it has to be some grand plan I believe I've said this since day one the only issue at the immigra at the border was the bring these people in and somehow get them to vote and turn every state blue so they never get out of power this is nothing but a power struggle that's all it is my view on well yeah my view on the whole illegal immigrant thing is I don't believe most of them are even going to vote to be honest with you I don't believe they're even going to vote I think they're just letting them in so that they can rig the ballot boxes themselves yeah and blame them I don't I I mean I have enough of a brain I've been around the world enough to know that if an illegal immigrant bothers to cross across the jungle and risk his life and sneak into America he's trying to eat he's trying to sleep he's trying to find a way to get on with his life I can't see him standing in line at a government office box for a language he doesn't truly understand even if you tell him this particular party will allow you to stay this one won't I don't I just can't see them all getting in line and getting out there and waiting their turn to cast a vote I don't think so at all I think they're letting all these people in so that they can rig the election how they want so they can steal millions of votes blame it all on people we never know who they are and we can't check it and it's all just a big setup I don't even think the illegals are going to vote themselves I think they're just going to rig it from the beginning and then you end up in a position where democracy doesn't work anymore what comes after that right we'll have this illusion of garbage democracy but that's going to shatter in real time maybe maybe Trump's job is just to highlight the fact that the system doesn't work anymore but what comes afterwards I mean America can't survive the breakdown of democracy I don't see how it can survive it it's too fragmented there's nothing unifying it there's nothing that's going to hold it together besides this idea of freedom and democracy what else do they have you think if we lose this when I say we you know Trump loses this election do you think America is that's it that's their final chance I think that's their final chance I don't think it'll ever be the same again I think that it's going to be a signal to not only anyone with a brain but also anyone with power to get what they can and prepare to get out I really believe there's going to be a lot of people start building lifeboats you know what's quite interesting about America I've always found this interesting is that American Wealth is is quite centralized like I'm I grew up in England I'm born in America I grew up in England if you get rich in England mhm you consider a house in Spain or you consider a house in Dubai or you consider a house in Italy if you get rich in America you consider a house in California or Miami it's all kind of there most people don't consider other places they consider another state absolutely that's how America kind of is I think once large swaths of the American population especially the wealth start to think you know what we might need something somewhere else that there's going to be a huge brain drain and wealth drain and you highlighted earlier how much debt they're in I mean they can't afford these kind of things they can't afford all of the money to start saying you know what we don't feel safe here anymore and you got all all the wealthy in the country now building bunkers I mean I you I have to respect the patriotism of Americans I mean they want to they want to fight it out to the end and I respect that absolutely but there's going to be a large group of people and the reason I'm saying this is because of England I think England last year lost seven or eight% of its millionaires everyone left everyone went to Dubai Italy Spain anyone with money looked around at the crime and just thought them out once that starts happening you have real problems because then the country gets poorer and then the poor get poorer and then they want more from the government so the person who wins is the person who promises them even more that took about further down the rabbit hole to socialism further down the rabbit hole to Forever country debt further down the rabbit hole to needing the government to survive and this is what happens America was built on individual exceptionalism and rich people paying paying taxes and building these big companies and all this Brilliance and it's just collapsing in Real Time With Envy and Petty and pettiness and hatred man it's sad to see it's sad to see because I mean you say you're 73 I'm 37 the other way around I'll be alive to watch all this stuff yes and and the world is speeding up what used to take a hundred years now takes 10 quick right I mean I really think in 50 years America's going to be a completely different place and how it looks I think it depends on this election and it's kind of scary and I I feel like I guess one of the reasons I'm anxious I've done this Michael I've looked at a globe okay where do I go you end up looking at Iceland and fallard and these chiny little Islands I mean all all what do all what does anyone really want you want your family safe you want to be treated fairly under the law yes you want to be left alone isn't it remarkable that that's so hard to find you know I've been starting to you know reality is kicking in I've been starting to look myself I said what are we going to do you know because again I don't think we survived three and a half years another four years of this after the last three and a half but yeah that's a good question where do you go well the worst thing about it is you know what the actual worst thing about it is the American collapse won't be people turning on the government who are the ones who did it it'll be the Americans turning on each other the worst thing about it is when the rich get in trouble they're very good at turning the poor people on the poor people I've never seen a rich black person meet a rich white person and be racist ever they're rich they're rich racism doesn't exist once you're rich you walk into the yacht dealership it doesn't matter what color you are you could be purple they don't care 100% But as soon as things get hard the rich do very good at turning the blacks on the whites on the Dems on the whoever and they manage to just mix it all up let them all fight while they're jet fueled every single time you know I don't I don't know how you feel about this but I don't see racism in America anymore not in this generation I really don't and you know the funny thing it's if you go on social media now it's all the blacks that are talking negative about KLA Harris that's SE see through her whole game Y and it's the whites that are supporting her yep they see through her game y especially in California y because she locked up so many black guys there for nonsense for BS they see through it even the black women yep but it's the white women and white guys that are supporting her and they're supposed to be allegedly the educated ones well they they well what do we say they they don't like objective truth they want to see a truth that makes them feel good this is the thing that's so interesting about morality because I argue these things all the time especially when it comes to immigration people say oh you know but they people need a better life and they believe they're moral but they can't think one step further down the chessboard okay you believe your moral allowing people into the country without a passport you believe you're doing the right thing if those people kill people that's not a moral decision to make can't you think one layer deeper can't you understand you're destroying the country and Innocents are dying can't you understand you're encouraging more people to now flee that country and some of them will die on the way like you're not even making a moral decision what's so interesting to me is that not only are these people stupid but somehow they believe and even I think it's a mistake of us as well sometimes we talk about them like they have a a mindset of morality that we don't quite have we try and sound like we're the hard tough ones and we sit and say like well listen I'm realistic and you idealistic and you're more more you have these moral ideals no our ideals are moral protection is moral preventing bad things happening to the people who are already in the country is moral preventing a breakdown of services is moral making sure the people who tried to get into America legally and followed the system are rewarded is moral law and order these things are moral you need to have these things it's actually immoral to say that all the rules can constantly be broken but Andrew there's there's I would bet my entire life on the fact there is no humanitarian reason whatsoever that they're having this people coming over the Border they don't care about that they don't care about anybody put those people in their neighborhood forget it they'll be screaming and we we've already seen that but let me ask you this this is interesting as a Christian we have our Bible yeah America doesn't exist you can't find it anywhere what do you think what do you think happens doesn't exist and you know I look biblically I said maybe this is our time maybe that's where I'm not saying in the next 5 10 years but maybe this is this is the pattern and this is the the beginning of the real destruction and downfall of America I've heard that from a lot of people you know the world has ended a lot of times the world has ended many times before and like a new world comes from it but the world can end and people can experience a world ending event imagine you lived in I don't know Hamburg in World War II it pretty much would feel like the world was ending I mean the planes are dropping bombs and everybody's dying the whole place is on fire and there's nowhere to go and Germany's going to lose and if you have any kind of money or resource or brain you might be able to run to surrender to the Americans because if you surrender to the Russians you're in big trouble the world ends and bad things happen and a new world is built from it but there is always a generation of people who have to experience the world ending and I feel like we might be that generation this time like something's going to happen big and it's going to be nasty and it's going to be ugly and there's going to be a world- ending event and then you have to look and like you said what galvanizes people what keeps people together enough to resist these kind of things what's going to keep Humanity together what's going to keep America together what's going to keep people functioning I mean we I my theories and I've talked about this on podcast is I believe the next version of of humanity is going to be a technical Empire where they control absolutely everything we've ever done I think that technology is going to be used against us and we're going to have QR codes in our arms and they're going to know everywhere we go and they're going to know everything we say and they're going to know where we drive and we're going to have carbon credits and a certain amount of money is going to be allowed to us I think all of that's coming which is of course a form of slavery guess you have to ask are the elites happy to let America all blow up so they can come along and Implement that maybe they need the fire to implement maybe they need the forest fire people only people have only ever given up their freedom for safety it's all you give up your freedom for right if you say you're taking away my freedom if they say yes but you'll be safe Co proved that yeah so maybe they wanted old to burn you know maybe they have no intention of stopping it from burning maybe they want it to get worse and worse till it gets to a point where people will do anything to feel safe again including stamp that QR code on their forehead yeah and then you just get to live as a machine I guess and that's the human spirit and human Ingenuity gone I mean once artificial intelligence outpaces the human mind which isn't far off what do they even need individual exceptionalism for what do they need your life experiences and your ability to articulate them for when they have ai machine that can do a thousand times better yeah what's left for Humanity besides being slave drones who obey with no one who's particularly exciting or excellent or interesting or different the AI handles all of that the machine keeps us all in control the server is buried underneath a mountain somewhere the elit are on God knows which island and we're just left with the mess and there will be a point in history I really believe this even when I go through my problems or you recently got Matrix attacked I really think they're going to look back to this period in history to see who was trying to say what's going to happen I really believe this is the point they're going to say you know what it was around the 2025 2035 something could have stopped what ended up happening who even me who even realized and perhaps I get some Solace from at least knowing we'll be on the right side of it all because I really don't think anyone's going to look back on our points of view and think we were wrong yeah I agree well listen I think uh if this election goes this way this is the biggest scam that was ever put on the American people if she wins this election the way they're engineering it now I got to tell you it's brilliant there's no question it's brilliant the way they're doing it just recreating her um I believe if if this happen she stays in power comes into Power whatever uh I think that's the really beginning of our downfall I mean real I mean we're slowly falling off a click but I think it's going to be a sharp fall at that point well I'm honestly it's going to be a signal to the rest of the world that now is the time to hit America I mean I mean look all the things people have done under Biden yeah like I understand Putin and I understand his motivations and I believe he has the will to really do the best for the Russian people I believe all of that I believe he's competent I believe he's smart but I also don't believe he would have done what he did under Trump I I believe he knew I believe he knew it's now or never way it's now or never and we're going to do it because Putin cares about Russia and when you care about Russia you want America weak did you ever watch the Tucker Carlson interview with Putin I watched some of the yeah and people were always people were expecting Putin to say the same things I found this really interesting because Putin talks on stage how America's run by satanists mhm globo homo they're destroying the family unit America's going to collapse it's going to implode under his own decadence he says all these things and everyone was really worried the whole establishment The Matrix media machine was coming hard on Tucker saying if he interviews Putin he deserves to go to jail he's a traitor and when he sat down with Putin Putin didn't say any of that Putin talked about Russian history for an hour all the way back to the year 700 and then when they asked him questions about America he said I'm not really that interested in what America does I'm interested in what Russia does I don't really care and he said nothing really of significance and people were sitting there a bit confused saying yeah why didn't expect the devil to come out in here and everybody see the devil that's right they're like why didn't Putin tell the American population that they're run by satanists why didn't he say the things he always says normally why didn't he wake people up Putin doesn't want the Americans awake right Putin wants Russia to win we may look at Putin with respect because we understand he knows how to run a country Putin doesn't want the Americans to understand we're run by Satanist he wants us to sleep walk into Oblivion so that Russia can win so he sat there and made sure he said nothing that's going to wake up the average American person MH people in China the leaders of China leaders of Russia leaders of the Middle East Etc they're waiting for America to collapse yeah and in many ways truthfully I hope they're I believe they're praying for Camala to win there there's some of them sitting there going if they mess this up they're going to give us another chance to put another nail in that coffin oh I no doubt they want kamla to win they don't want Trump in there no I was thinking if they thought prior to her to Biden stepping down I thought that if they believed Trump was going to win that they were going to do something drastic within the next couple of months before he took office y yeah but who knows now and I I still feel that might happen if they feel that this is turning a little bit she starts answering some questions for the can you believe that you have a presidential candidate that's what a month already has not answered one question to a reporter not one and she's getting away with it it's the basement strategy with Biden and doing the same thing with her just keeping the people ignorant she doesn't have to respond to anything I'm saying it's the greatest scam ever put across this country it's it's unbelievable and getting away with it I wish these people were sentient enough to even speak to because I don't think they are I think they're just robots but I'd say do you think that kamala's top 10% smartest women in America God the top 10% we can argue Trump's one of the top 10 you can even say top 20% smartest men in America I'm not saying he's the smartest guy he's been around do you think Kamala is the best female we have of 330 million people do you think she's the top 10% smartest women I know women who work at a grocery store who know more about the world and have more Street smarts and more wit and more grit than her who are more prepared to stand up and fight for the American people than she is it's incredible she's the bottom percentile but truth isn't real all that's real is feelings this is why they attack masculinity so hard because masculinity is very logically based femininity as a whole is emotionally based and the reason they try and spread femininity and feminism and put women in charge and bring a matriarchy around and feminize men is because once people think emotionally nothing is real anymore nothing is true or false it's all about can you convince them of can you scare them enough can you give them enough of an argument too it's not a matter of logically it doesn't make sense it's what I feel I feel I'm a good person if well then it's wide open right there's no longer it doesn't make any sense there are people who truly believe that there shouldn't be a border to a country and that countries don't need borders and that that's racist to have a border yeah you know what's so interesting about these arguments every Islamic country has a border every African country has a border China has a border Russia has a border there's not a country in the world without a border besides these Western Nation that are self- imploding you know we talk about morality and you gauge morality it's interesting because I was also talking to someone else and they were saying well what are you supposed to do at the southern border and I said I'll tell you what I would do and this will get a lot of people calling me immoral but this is what I would do I build a wall I'd give a two- week notice so everybody understood it'd be blasted in every language from loudspeakers and it'd be all over all the news you have two weeks until we start using deadly force don't come near this wall nobody would get accidentally shot because they've been warned and they knew right that's what you do because if you're not prepared to pull the trigger what can you do you mean water cannons fences you can do XY Z you can pick them up you can try and Deport them to they're going to keep coming they're going to keep coming you think Russia doesn't use deadly force at his border of course you think China doesn't use deadly force at its border you think the United Arab Emirates and Qatar and baret and Kain you every country in the world uses deadly force at its border and I guess I'm just hoping to come to you for some answers about their for our children M that's obvious we don't have a border anymore throughout history the hill to die on was always your land your women your children they've taken it all what's it going to take for people to finally wake up what's the hill to die on I mean surely the hill to die on was them scoping your kids into removing their genitals surely the hill to die on was a wide open border where people can flood in and murder your wife no what's the hill to die on what's left that's what I'm saying I I don't get it I don't understand I don't know I don't have that answer because it's it's mindboggling it really is when you say they're coming for our kids I mean when they're when they're taking you know the rights of parents to have any kind of say so over their kids changing their gender getting gender affirming surgery which is basically mutil mutilation they want to destroy the family unit no question they want to control our kids from early on because they don't have any kids of their own of course they got to take ours uh and people don't see this and that's and that's only part of the scop right part of the scop is you as a parent cannot stop your child from changing gender that's the first part that's that's the end result of the scop the beginning of the SOP is we're going to inflate the currency to the point where both parents are working so you barely see your own kids you can't afford to be at home there is no mom staying home with the kids anymore no you're both working to pay for pay a job they're going to go to school you're not going to have any idea what the educational board's going to teach them they're going to be on the internet we're going to push all this transgender garbage to the front of YouTube we're going to push it all to the front so the actual beginning of the scop is removing the parental control over the child letting the school and the internet rais them forcing that full of propaganda and then the final nail in the coffin is once they've been brainwashed and cop because you as a parent by the time you finish work clean the house you have an hour a day with your kids if you're lucky competing with 12 hours a day of indoctrination then you don't have a say over what your child then decides to do after being brainwashed by the machine and and the Machine is deliberately designed to be as addictive as possible it's designed to be entertaining designed to get clicks designed to be congested and watched and ingested and you're supposed to sit there and they stare at these screens for hours a day and then finally when push comes to shove you're not allowed to stop them that is the final nail in the coffin it's absolutely incredible and that's why they have no problem with inflating the currency and putting both parents out to work and sending your kids off to school to some educational board to teach them Absolute garbage I think they were doing this also with vaccines they were vaccinating kids without their opinion absolutely without their permission I mean they came for the kids they came for the land your women aren't safe to walk the street anymore I don't know what hill we're supposed to die on I I don't know what's going to what it's going to take for people to realize that maybe people just aren't well traveled enough you know there are first world Nations where you can walk around safely your kids aren't taught garbage men women family like there's a lot countries there's so many beautiful cities in the world you can go to you ain't got worry about anything bad happening to you you can wear a nice watch you can drive a nice car these places do exist in America we seem to believe that it'd be impossible to have a large city without these issues I can name 20 they're all over the world but man scary well listen I don't I don't know how it's going to end but uh I'm normally a very optimistic guy but I feel very pessimistic about what's happening here in the next couple of months in America I don't know I mean I'm making plans myself if this doesn't work out you know if she becomes president I'm leaving not for that I'm worried about the destruction of my country as I know it yeah and I'm saying you know what am I going to do where am I going to take my kids and my grandkids you know I I I I don't understand how any red-blooded male with half a brain isn't slightly anxious in the world today got to be you if you have half a protective Instinct inside of you have to be you have have to be thinking as you go to sleep at night what am I going to do if this happens and if you're not thinking that way perhaps you're part of the problem because it's glaringly obvious what their intentions are and their intentions are to lock up anyone who talks about what they're going to do and and burn it all to the ground for themselves that's the intention and it seems like it's very difficult to stop at this point because you know look I always said this you know uh real downfall of our country is when the media is is starting to be controlled by the the government in power and that's what's happening they don't tell the truth anymore they don't report the news anymore all they do is cover for the current Administration when that happens people don't get the news they don't know what's really going on it's all about propaganda it's like Russia China anywhere else yeah you know that's happened big time and then of course weaponizing yep uh the uh government agencies to go after their political enemies and they're all worried about Trump doing that this guy's been the victim of that for years now and they're worri about him him doing it and people people buy into that they don't see what's happening another thing that's scary I completely agree with you but you know why it's even scarier in America than these other places because you look at I don't know we take China for example the state media's propagandists for the government and the regime understand fine but you know who runs the government so you know who at least the boss is so at least if people are unhappy even if they're being bombarded with propaganda even if the government controls how the country works and even if it's very controlled Society if people are unhappy they at least know who to point the finger at yeah I think the scariest thing about the West now is nobody's accountable because nobody knows who the boss is you believe Biden's right now calling shots he never was so who has it been and you can go WF or globo homo or this group or that group or the banks or the media who we don't even know who's in charge anymore you're right you want to talk about removing resp responsibility well to remove responsibility you remove accountability right if you're sitting in front of a pile of money and nobody knows who you are you can steal it if there's a big pile of money and they say Andrew Tate sitting in front of that money as soon as some's missing they know who to go for they know where to go so we don't even have accountability which is the most basic point and one of the tenants of democracy in the first place to know who's supposed to be in charge so we know who's responsible for things it's just passing the buck lying shadow orgs this forever bu bureaucrats who've been in power for 20 30 years m i mean I don't even know I'm sure there's some position somewhere deep in the government where you get to make perhaps not laws but regulations yeah what's the difference you just do them as you want nobody knows your name exactly and you operate with impunity and you've been there forever and I mean Putin did say one very interesting thing in his conversation with Tucker when Tucker was trying to press Putin about the Ukraine war yeah he wouldn't respond he wouldn't really but heude to he said well I don't talk to Biden I don't talk to president said my security service is they and they speak to the CIA so I guess the CIA is in charge yeah are they democratically elected no oh no I mean I guess the CIA are in charge now that's a guess but there's there's a lot of people now trying to put their fingers in this pie and walk out with a whole bunch of it and there doesn't seem to be very much left for the common person very interesting very scary position we're in and I guess the answer is just to try and get people to pay attention long enough to see the truth and to speak about it and to not believe the garbage anymore I I really believed after covid they couldn't do something like that again and then I saw this Camala crab yeah and I'm starting to think you know what they might even be able to pull off they might be able to pull it off all over again 100% doing it again this race shouldn't even be it shouldn't even be close it should be no anybody with a brain you look and say look I can't go through this anymore I see what's happening it's right in front of my eyes but they deny it or they don't see it or they're just ignorant y but that's such a a a level of ignorance that's beyond belief so there has to be more to it I I I don't know I I just don't get it this hatred that they got for this guy the guy that did a good job when he was office all these things that are happening Andro you know another thing too this whole transgender move I mean I've been very outspoken about it you know and listen I I I probably have the same feeling as you do what you want yep Don't Force It on me yeah don't force it on my kids don't tell me I have to celebrate pride month for a month don't tell me I have to do all why I'm not forcing my beliefs on you why are you doing that to me veterans get a day you know and they get a month a day every holiday gets a day just about and they get a month it's the final attack on objective morality It's the final attack on Truth once they can force you to look at the sky and say it's green they win then it's over the slave programming is fully installed once they can force you to look at a man and say it's a woman then they finally win now there is no such thing as truth you ignore your own eyes no matter what your eyes tell you you believe the news over your eyes and how do they do that well they do that by forcing you to at least say it most people in most jobs they'll lose their job if they don't say it absolutely they have to say it they have to say it if you say it enough eventually you'll stop thinking the opposite and they just slowly grind down the population that's what they're going to do until eventually we talk about transgenderism now as if it's controversial in 100 years from now it's going to be the most oh yeah why was it oh she he she he back and forth slowly slowly and I guess when you talk about the enemies of Freedom one of the things they do very well is that they think generationally they think my son's son will be in charge of this mess hopefully one day so I'll set up this garbage now it may take 60 70 years to get in but in the end we'll get what we want you know it's kind of interesting people often think that a lot of things are done for money and a lot of them are but money is power and it's the power they really want 100% I mean you know better than me money gets boring power never really gets boring it's all about the power power stays fun absolutely and you always want more absolutely it's all about money and power and and and that's what they really want and and they're prepared to destroy the entire economy and set it all on fire because they print the money anyway yeah they they'll have food they'll be fine but they want you on your knees begging yeah that's what they want that's what they really want and it's working they're getting it you know I'll tell you this right now if uh if any transgender guy whatever they call themselves walked into a bathroom with my daughter and does anything I'm going to jail 100% I'm going to jail 100% 100% And it's so disgusting that the same people who want to scream feminism scream I'm a misogynist I'm a bad person scream about how the borders need to be open because people need to have a fair chance at life are the same people saying that you can put men in women's bathrooms yeah and that if women are attacked that's just something we should ignore and we should eat for the greater good these people are not moral people where's all the feminist groups oh yeah we're are the F's no feminist why why they not screaming at the top of the why they not you know supporting Riley gains and everything she's trying to do no they're still screaming about Trump saying something about grabbing her by the [ __ ] 15 years ago 20 years ago in a locker room yeah who cares I mean I guarantee you women feel safer around Trump than they do any of these male feminists I guarantee you any day of the week they'd rather stand around Trump than they will any of these weirdo male feminists unbelievable what do you think of this whole transgender to fighters in the Olympics how did they allow that bro again and and that's the thing that's so interesting about the debate on it right because it's like is she a man is she a woman well she was born with this she was born with that one board said yes one board said no we've reached a level of subjectivity where there's no objective truth it shouldn't be difficult man woman it should it's the easiest thing in the world right but they're going to subjectivity is how they're going to infiltrate everything well maybe but could be but exception but let's blur the lines they're trying to blur the lines of absolutely everything on purpose now if you were to ask the average person in America what makes a good person and you were to say well a person who stands up for what he believes is is right and a person who defends his family and a person who works hard and a person who you know comes home every night to his kid whatever I guarantee you no matter what you give as an answer there's going to be a lot of people who would disagree with you go that's not a good person actually the MH you know feminists say you're a bad man if you try and protect and provide for a woman right I had Piers Morgan sit there who I actually half likee half the time when I said my woman doesn't have to work unless she wants to she doesn't have to work he attacked me for that as if I was a terrible person because oh yeah but why wouldn't she work well if she wants to work she can work but she doesn't need to work why not because she doesn't need to because it's my job to protect and provide I provide for her she doesn't have to work if she doesn't want to oh that's misogynistic why why what was his response to that why well he didn't have much of an answer he was just like oh I you you because he was trying to accuse me of being misogynistic for believing that men should be coarsened by the difficulties of life and that a woman's Beauty what's attractive in a woman often is her innocence and her Purity you don't want a woman I would hate to be with a woman who's been through what I've been through it would scare me like you're still alive she'd probably be a psychopath she'd probably be dangerous you add in the trauma we've been through plus some female emotionality plus the the ruthlessness of survival many women have she'd be more dangerous than any man I wouldn't I wouldn't want to be around her I agree you know women are there to be protected we've always understood that I don't know why even that's controversial now so why I was going to say why do you think that it's it's demeaning to a woman if you say I'm your protector well they're trying to pretend because once again objective realities become so blurred they're trying to pretend that a woman can do everything a man can do in fact better than a man can because it's all an attack on masculinity so they're saying that everything a man can do a woman can actually do better and if you take something as Baseline as physical violence which we all know the answer to they're going to sit there and go no that's not the case Noe women can do it just go a woman could protect herself just as well you're a misogynist and there are people who will sit there and regurgitate that and try and defend that point of view with you there's no objective reality anymore it's absolutely crazy well I tell you I've said people I don't want my wife to work and I sure why not number one she doesn't have to and number two I don't want somebody else telling my wife what to do absolutely period absolutely why do why do us men suffer and work at all why do we struggle and take all the risks we took to get rich is so we can let other people not work there's a there's a beautiful poem it's an Arabic poem and I don't know it word for word and I I can't even quote who who made it I think it was a warlord or a king but he said stress is mine happiness is yours pain is mine Joy is yours but you are mine mhm and he's said I suffer and you get the good side of my suffering but you're mine and that's the masculine Essence in the first place that's the reason I mean look at Christmas Day Dad gets the wor first presents he gives the present he gets a tie that's right that's what men are supposed to do and that's why we work all all year long and and there's a lot of men who are up there now I mean I don't know if you saw this in Iceland did you see the female strike in Iceland yeah yeah bro that was amazing all the women went on strike because they were complaining they don't get paid as much as men and the country worked just fine yeah they disproved their point absolutely all the HR departments all the little little emails didn't get sent the roads still work they like trissy you was still on let all the men stop going to work for a week and you'll see you know men men are out here suffering all day every day to protect and provide but somehow that makes you a bad person that actually makes you oppressive yeah you're a bad if you make more money than your wife that's because you're an oppressive it's the patriarchal system and it's the gender pay Gap and you're oppressive and you're trying to oppress her right and demean her and demean her because you're out there working your ass off for her yeah but it wasn't always that way this is this is this new generation of thought that's just so upside down you know and I believe and you know this is a tough conversation because people right away I believe that women that were never treated that way are the ones that feel that feel that you know guys are being misogynists they never had a guy that went out of their way for them and really treated them like a woman should be treated yep Oh no you're completely right which is why they look the way they look because if you if you get treated that way why would you want anything else if you had a man taken care of you respecting you honoring you but taking care of you so you don't have to do the things that he has to do you know why would you reject that you wouldn't that's right but those women that don't get that they're the ones that scream the loudest oh yeah the beautiful women love gender roles yeah the beautiful women love gender roles yes they love gender roles it's the other team but they've been weaponized and they've been with this weaponized morality and us propping up people who really don't have much Merit perhaps in days of old you need to have Merit to have a voice you had to have done something or you had to have some degree of individual exceptionalism for anyone to listen to you but now they can come along and take large swaths of idiots and use algorithms to amplify them and before you know it completely IR remarkable people who have achieved nothing besides hate others have a voice all of a sudden because algo has been decided to put them to the front so that they can be used to attack those who defend society as a whole I feel like it's all just a setup I mean truthfully in the 80s you you know I was I wasn't born till 86 but in the ' 80s or the 70s who would listen to these idiots nobody where would they even talk like who would even listen to these people these [ __ ] people we don't even pay attention yeah completely but now now they're the front page of every [ __ ] news but let let me ask you this all of these things taken together it almost sounds like somebody got in the back room a group of people got in the back room and they methodically planned all of this we're going to open the borders we're going to make kids independent of their their parents we're going to make guys want to be girls we're going to Pro push lbtq whatever it's called it's like one plan that did some group get together at some point and say this is what we're going to do and this is how we're going to take control maintain power and control I mean how do all these things happen at one time practically and that's that's what it seems like there some grand scheme that was put into effect by some or something yeah I think the scheme was implemented a while ago and now it's coming to a head and I think the primary goal if you add up the objectives of nearly all of those things is to remove the masculine Instinct remove masculin e because they're The Defenders of society I think that it's always the men who are going to be prepared to die on the hill so they just want to turn all the men into cowards and [ __ ] so nobody wants to go and die on that hill so they can do whatever they want but when when you talk about the Deep State Andrew deep you believe that there's some cynical force behind this a group of people that really has control and said this is this is the way we're going to destroy this to a point where we can take full control over people because all these things happening it's almost at light speed in in the last couple of years it's really moving quick and people are really buying into this quickly and I look at our education system you know we we once something to be proud of we were up there in the world and now we're I don't 49th or something crazy number kids are not Eventing getting educated and obviously Co you know played a big part in that keeping kids out of school for a year a year and a half it can't it can't even catch up at this point right now the teachers unions want it that way they're part of the whole Matrix I believe but it seems like there was some grand scheme that maybe a couple of years back or at some point in time they said okay methodically this is how we're going to have to work this out so we can maintain uh Power and keep it forever yeah I have a few theories on who it is and when it's started but I think primarily there's a subsect of the population who are interested in their own bloodline and their own power and their own control and they're only interested in protecting their own profits and they understand that the enemy to their profits are going to be the Ambitions and the morality of the common man having ambitious moral perspicacious normal citizens who can pay attention who have a strong belief in honor and Duty and dignity and they want to work hard and they want to have a good life for themselves they're going to be the enemy of these forever prophets and these people who are trying to exploit society and I feel like their intention has always been to reduce the power of their enemy it's what we do right it's what is how War works you want to reduce the power of your enemy and they've just come along and thought you know the biggest troublemakers the biggest people who stand in the way to our plan are the moral are the men who are not afraid are the brave men who love their family so let's try and get rid of The Bravery let's try and get rid of the courage let's try and get rid of the family that they prepared to die for let's just attack all these institutions that are inspiring men to stand up I said this the other day I said this after I did the process about Jesus people said oh yeah fantastic I'm you did a great job and I said that's yeah it is great you know and I've got a platform you've got a platform we're doing our best but truthfully you need the common man to stand up to evil it can't just be a few of us it has to be a lot of us which means you need the Common Man by extension common means a lot yeah the common man now has been so demoralized he can't even get a woman who respects him if you don't have a woman who respects you and you don't have a family what are you going to fight for what are you going to die for yeah so you're just going to play video games to the end and watch all burm and make memes and think it's funny right so the common man's been so demoralized now and they've done that with this feminism and this Insanity social media XYZ I totally understand and I'm not blaming women for this but the average girl is scrolling Instagram trying to catch her ass a millionaire there aren't enough millionaires there's a lot of common men out there who can't even get a woman who's going to feed them a nice meal and make them A coffee each morning how can we expect them to stand up and defend a society where they don't feel respected they don't have a family women treat them like [ __ ] all of this feminism's got on these women Minds where they think they're too good for anybody like everything's broken from the absolute core and you're right this is fairly recent I mean I don't I would argue in the 80s if you're the hot girl in the town and there's a guy in the town and you meet it is what it is but now if you're the beautiful girl in Nebraska you're on a plane to the Maldives with some dude from Russia yeah like it's the whole thing's all messed up you know and and the local dude in Nebraska what's he left with and then you're asking him to get on the front line and you're asking him to defend that Society the common man's been so brutally demoralized so brutally demoralized that even the ones who understand every word we're saying are like well what what where's my skin in the game you know if you don't feel like the king of your household why would you fight to defend it you got to have a small Kingdom you want to defend if you feel like the king of your household you're prepared to not let anyone come anywhere near that house yeah but if you're like well okay maybe I got a wife but she talks to me like [ __ ] and I'm working non-stop my kids don't listen kids is listening to the teacher about LGBT like you're just going to lose your mind you're just going to sit there and wait to die it's truly incredible the amount of damage they've managed to do to Society on a level of the nucleus of the cell is broken the the constant bombardment the constant propaganda the constant inversion of natural gender roles I would argue there you'd struggle to find a house in Russia where the man's not the man of the house I mean I'd argue it'd be hard to find you know but now it gets to a point where we have enemies serious enemies and these people that are in power if we ever if these enemies ever overtake us they're not going to be in power anymore right and they they don't even see that they don't even get that it's just the same way like these people that are protesting that are gays and lesbians they don't realize that if they were in any place but America they probably wouldn't exist the countries that they're supporting they wouldn't exist right and and it's just I don't know I guess it's the level of ignorance or they're so detached from reality that they can't see this perhaps it's not ignorance you know perhaps if we had to be honest about it perhaps some people are just self destructive and they just want to burn everything with them perhaps some people just want to see the world burn perhaps it's not ignorance perhaps they understand what they're doing and they just want to see the world burn they're bitter and they're sad and they want it all to burn down they hate the system because they can't win under the system they hate the meritocracy they hate the patriarchy where you have to be a man of Duty and courage and honor because they can't compete they feel like they're losing under the current rules and they just want to burn it all to the ground hoping that perhaps something better will be set up or even not just we're playing a game of chess I'm losing because I'm a loser so throw all the pieces off the board and if you try to explain to him if you throw the pieces off the board chaos comes Anarchy comes Yeah well yeah but I keep losing so burn it all down a lot of these people truthfully just want to see the world burn I believe that they don't even want America to do well even at their own personal expense as as crazy as that may sound they're already at the bottom so I mean the scary thing about Amer ocracy is you're always going to have 50% of people who are below average in a meritocracy even if it's a perfectly Fair one I mean we I'm going to say this it's get me in a lot of trouble but I'm going to say it if you look at the face of a woman who's conservative who believes in family and you look at the face of these trolls it's not hard to see like it's not hard to see who's on which side of the fence get in trouble but it's the truth it's the truth right no doubt so they're just upset with the system and they just want to burn it all to the ground they want everyone to suffer and what's the mistake that's been made is that they've ever got a voice at all but I guess the question is if that's a mistake or that was purpose purposely designed like we said who's finding these people who's organizing them who's amplifying them who's getting all these idiots in one place who's giving them all the same sign who's behind these these people who's giving them Air Time who's pushing them to the front of alos who's bringing them on who's bringing them on the news to even debate their garbage who's putting on the TV these people should be shunned and ignored but for some reason somehow they're being found and pushed to the front as this very vocal and I'd argue even now as crazy as America is I'd still argue they're a minority they're a vocal psycho minority and they look bigger than they are because they're being Amplified MH so you want to ask who's destroying the world who's amplifying them who's finding them and going this will damage this will do do more damage to the masculine duty to protect society and that's what I want to do so get this person get make her a newscaster put this IDI up there and put her on tv eight times a week and promote her show those shows don't make money no no one buys those shows who's putting them up there that's what you really have to do and if you I guess if we want to do our research we should find a list of the 100 top idiots and find out which production companies they work for we could probably start digging a little bit and maybe get some answers because there is no way it's a coincidence that they keep finding these clowns and putting them in everyone's face and you're right they don't make money for anybody they're just there they're just there it's incredible the msm's a perfect example of that who buys the media nobody MH every government in the world spends endless money keeping these stupid orgs alive to lie to you yeah that's it if they were telling you the truth you'd have to pay for it right they're telling you the truth it wouldn't be free it wouldn't be on in every Lounge it wouldn't be on in every airport it wouldn't be shoved down your throat it wouldn't be mentioned all the time it's all lies I mean they have a job to do and they're paid by the government to lie to you that's what it is which brings me to the to the view oh my God I look I can't look at that for more than two or three minutes before I want to get sick to my stomach who watches these people I saw even listens to them I saw a girl a girl who I knew and she was reading a book um why men love [ __ ] I think it was called and it was about it was a feminist book about why men love women who are horrible which of course is not the case at all and I said have you even looked up the author of that book she goes no no I like well look it up like even I don't know the answer to this I'm curious who wrote This Book some 55-year-old single woman with no kids of course why are you listening to her like don't you want to qualify your information on any level bro it's incred well I saw the book on TV bro it's incredible it's incredible but it's an orchestrated attempt which is why they try very hard to stifle our influence we are the enemies in the information War it's an information War it's a war of ideas we're very much combatants I was not surprised I was saying for a very long time before I went to jail they're going to do something there's no way they're going to spend all this money and all this time trying to push all these ideas and I'm going to become so well known against those ideas without them saying shut him up sure you knew it was coming I knew it was coming that's the way the world is I mean we my upbringing I cannot compare to yours but I know enough about the world to know that if you you [ __ ] with people who have control of a certain area I've seen what happens I know how it goes did you expect it to happen here no I I I us I refuse to fly to America I refuse to do jogan I turned down so many opportunities in America because I thought they were the ones who would get but I guess the the arm the arm is long their influence here their arm is long so like if it's not Iran China or Russia they can get you basically anywhere 100% so what can you do and then I mean you you I'm sure you've been asked this yourself why don't you just shut up but then you have to look yourself in the mirror every day right coward that's right I don't and I don't know if I could don't know if I can go down that way I don't think I can go out as a coward I I have to be at least a thorn in their side to the end absolutely even if I lose I've got to be the guy who has annoyed them well it's not only that you're having a powerful influence on people people are paying attention some of them are a great major not a great majority but a great number of them are you know listen I've spoken to so many men that follow you young guys yeah really that follow you as a matter of fact my oh I have to ask you this where I'll be in trouble all right my wife's sister's uh son my nephew yeah is a huge fan of yours he's a soccer player okay he's actually going to Manchester they're bringing him me 16 years old wow and when he heard that I was seeing you he went crazy him and all of his friends all these 60 olds they they're too young to get on your site oh wow but if you give them a shout out what's the names oh what's all that bun of them yeah there a bunch of them I'll put something together for them yeah the guys in Manchester for the Manchester mandm I'll put something together I'll put something together his name is will will yeah will take care of yourself train hard become extremely successful stay off the streets stay out the clubs don't go down any of that mess you're at the height of your energetic powers and it should all be focused in the correct direction you'll be glad you used it correctly when you're older and uh wishing you the best of success and hopefully maybe one day in the future I'll be in Manchester hopefully maybe we'll grab a coffee or something and we'll pay attention to that now yeah absolutely because I see these These are the young guys that you're having a strong influence on and look he's a soccer player he wants to earn money this is what his thought is loves his mom loves his family he's a good kid and all the kids in his school around them the same way they need positive role models Andrew and you're one of them there's no question well I do my best there aren't that many left I mean they they say I'm so negative and I'm so dangerous and I say okay that's fine when I sat with the BBC I said fine you have your review on me that's fine then who who is leading then name someone who's good they can't even name someone who's good and they do name someone he's certainly not good you know it's like truly crazy but the leaders that are supposed to be good are not they're they're misleading and you get guys like us that speak our mind and really what are we doing it for you're not look looking to take control of the country I'm not I don't want anything I just want a good place to live absolutely for my wife and my kids and my grandkids that's it I want America to be the America that I grew up in and let me tell you I went through tough times on the street but you know at least we were we were criminals yeah you could kind of say okay you know if they stretch the law a little bit against these guys even though it's not right we kind of get it they're doing some damage so we got to counteract that in some way okay we get it but man when you're doing this to the general population you're misleading and you're you know Andrew I got to tell you this I don't think there's anything worse than somebody getting up there and telling people that are going to rely on them rely on what you say they give you your vote they trust in you you're going to act in their benefit and then you get into office and you turn around you do the exact opposite fraud hurting and crushing people I don't think there's anything worse than that we didn't do that on the street y absolutely it's fraud they they should go to jail for what they've done it's fraud absolutely it's fraudulent and they're lying you know what interesting because you talk about the common man I guess the biggest rebuttal I get from people is well if you just follow the law if you're just law- abiding you have nothing to worry about [ __ ] you know better than me I'm like have you read the law sir do you understand that you're now entering a position and you're entering a period of History where being a law-abiding citizen isn't even possible unless you really get on your knees and truly accept anything they force you to do 100% you haven't even read the law and it changes every day you don't even know what the law is you don't you're not in a position where you can be a law-abiding citizen and have a family and be left alone and raise them in peace you can't grow your own food you can't say anything against what the Matrix propaganda wants you to believe exactly you get you can't even be law-abiding anymore unless you're already a slave M and that's what's so scary is that there is no law- Abiding Citizen anymore who's a normal nice person that's what's really scary and you'll know and I have less experience in you but I've got enough experience to know how quickly they will twist and turn and lie and cheat their way to an indictment to just try and get you on some subjective garbage for any normal life that any person has ever lived purely because spoke against them and their system yeah there is no such thing as law abiding they can pick up any one of you watching this right now they could pick you up and they could find a crime 100% it's and they could find an indictment and they could they could type it up you know it's the classic the way you investigate a normal crime a crime occurs and you go out and investigate it and find the perpetrator find what happened but in a case like yours or mine or people that they don't like they're investigating you waiting to see if you're going to commit a crime or putting you in a situation where it's going to happen and trap you yeah that doesn't trap you oh we can't find enough well then let's just send him to the gas station and we'll set it all up and then we'll get his ass that way well they'll wire somebody up have a conversation with you that's a little bit off and before you know it you committed a crime you didn't even know you did it because some guy that was wired up talked to you made a deal with them happens all the time all the time and that's how they weaponize they used to do it against us okay I get it you trap one of us you put a wire on them you're going to go to jail jail unless you help us boom they come in they have conversations with us we're in trouble we didn't even have to commit the crime just talking about it is cons you know that right conspiracy you have to commit the crime just talk about it but now they're doing it against legitimate people their enemies that people they don't like put you in a situation where you say something you do something wrong in their View and boom you got an indictment and you're in trouble and then try to defend it normal guys you know look when I was when they locked me up violated my parole and they told they went into the bank they leaned all my bank accounts they took my car they did everything clean me out right you're getting another Rico indictment Rico indictment you don't beat them with a public defender I spent Millions defending myself normal guy doesn't have that you know normal guy doesn't have that money absolutely how do you defend it you don't you die you can't you just get crushed get crushed by the system so I guess to put a positive spin in conclusion I do like to think though as messed up as it all is sunlight is the best disinfectant and Truth is extremely important and I think it's very important we encourage people to see the truth tell the truth don't be afraid of whatever they're going to label you for the truth I'll do it again feminists are ugly I'll do it again there come at me it's it's objectively true I believe if we get enough people sticking to the truth and saying the truth it becomes harder and hard harder for their lies to stick because they are relying on in fact they require lies to pull all of this off it's an Empire of lies and the one thing lies need is a law of energy they have to repeat them over and over and over and it takes a lot less energy to tell the truth because if you can tell somebody something that just makes sense in their heart and soul that's it yeah so it's very important anybody with a brain speaks up when someone says they're not political or someone says they don't really care or they're not interested it's your job not to be aggressive not to be offensive but I'm now in the position in my life when we fight for Humanity and I'd be interested in your take on this if I sit with somebody at a dinner table and they're telling me they're pamala and every goes oh don't talk politics no I'm sorry this is for this is for Humanity and I'm going to tell them right here right there while I have the chance that they are wrong because this is more important than keeping a friendly dinner at a dinner table we're running out of time and it's very important that the truth is repeated as much as possible to anybody who is receptive or smart enough to understand it yeah well you know what take the word politics out of it it's not about politics and this is what I tell people these are about issues that are affecting your lives it's not politics politics is the way they're dealt with these issues and that's why we have to make choices and put the right people in office but these when you talk about people coming over the Border infiltrating your communities causing crime bringing drugs in that's not politics that's an issue that's affecting your life that's more than politics when yeah when you're talking about you know China and Russia and Iran you know our enemies that want to see us fall and want to see us conquered these are issues that are going to affect our lives politics is how they're dealt with but these are issues so the way you deal with that is by putting the right people in office not people that have been lying to you trying to enslave you telling you things that are absolutely not true lying to you over and over again you know so it's not about politics and but people can't get that through their head oh I don't want to talk politics neither do I I want to talk about ISS isues that are affecting you you go to the grocery store you're complaining about it y but why you putting the same people back in that have been lying to you and causing this y you know why are you doing that that's right and and you know and they can't answer Andrew they cannot answer well you don't know about Trump well I'm not talking about Trump I asked you a question why are you putting the same people back that have been lying make believe Trump doesn't exist y we don't want to talk about him why are you doing the same thing that has been causing you all this heartache and all this damage and everything why are you doing it again they don't know they don't know they can't answer you there's so much negativity or lies in their head about the other guy yeah that they can't answer you intelligently and they'll let it happen again absolutely and I don't know about that drives me crazy I just can't I can't understand it it's very upsetting when as a man you've gone through your life and I speak from personal experience I spent most of my waking hours trying to keep everyone I know and love and care about safe and fed and paid for and then some idiot is going to vote in some garbage that's going to make my job a 100 times harder or almost impossible that's very upsetting that's a direct attack on who I love that's a direct attack on me and it truly it truly is sad to listen to and it's I agree with you completely you know but what value do we have as men if we can't provide for and protect our families the people that we love even people in our communities you know back in the day in our community there was no crime in our community I bet there wasn't no you couldn't come in our neighborhood and commit crimes yeah wasn't gonna happen but what kind of man are you if you can't stand up for that yeah you know and and you ask any woman that's in a a good relationship whether it be a marriage or a boyfriend or girlfriend they're happy when they have a guy that's taking care of them and taking care of their responsibility they're not upset Y and they don't feel demeaned in any way they don't feel inferior of course they feel hey this is the way I'm being treated the right way absolutely you know I tell people look I put my wife on a pedestal yeah okay first of all she waited for me for8 years when I was away the girl went through a lot she deserves that y you know can she go to work if she wants to yeah would I like it no I'm being honest 100% you know I don't want another guy telling my wife what to do that's just how I feel 100% now you know you want to you want to get on me for that and say I'm a misogynist okay if that's your definition of a misogynist then that's what I am yeah but I feel the same way about my daughters you know yeah I mean look their guys come over the house that they bring you know I just tell them listen my daughters are very tough I'm telling you right now they're good girls they're independent they're tough but if you can't deal with that you're out yep period absolutely absolutely and I also they're going to have to respect you too goes both ways Y and if they don't respect you I don't care that it's my daughter get away from them go away y it goes both ways but guys don't have that mentality people don't have that mentality anymore a great majority of them and you know what Andrew they're in the minority yeah so why do we always why do we always fall to the minority and Pander to them yeah why that's true even even when you you think about the voting they're not a big voting block of course so that's why there's got to be some other scheme it's got to be about power or control or just destroying us because these are not the people that are putting you in office you know it's interesting I bet I mean you're 100% right if you were to go to a Border Town in America where the people are flooding across the border and you were to ask people should we build a wall here and you can ask black white Mexican whoever I the majority would say yeah build a wall yeah stop it it makes sense but they'll find this 10% of idiotic minority and push him to the front yeah and it's really I'm really glad we had this talk because it gave me something to think about because before I talk again I'm going to try and find out who's pushing these idiots and making out like they're larger and more powerful than they are and who's damaging the ideas everybody knows to be true by who's pushing these morons to the front I'm GNA tell you I I would go on that search with you but I can tell you that's dangerous because they don't want to be revealed well what did we say earlier what do they fear most is accountability that's right I mean if I were to say the right name right now I wouldn't do another podcast ever again MH you're you're absolutely right you know look I mean all we can do is do our part but we have to do it and I respect you a lot for what you do Andrew I mean that and look you know look there's a lot of controversy about me get it you know people are going to talk no matter what you do they're going to talk and uh you have the same you felt it the same but um when we're standing up for our principle and what we believe to be right and we're spreading good word out there and telling people the truth we have to live by that and if we don't do that we're cowards absolute cowards we guys say well what do you want me to do do something do something one of the things that make all of the legal bills and sleepless nights and jail cells and all the garbage worth it is meeting somebody else who's on the same Mission as you along the way so thank you very much oh thank you thank you brother thank you thank you very much and uh hopefully we'll sit around having a cigar in a few years and we were wrong we saved it all and it all went okay oh God but you know even if that happens we can Pat ourselves on the back we were part of it I was going to say we were part of it we we enlightened people we made them think we made them see the truth and this is all about about truth that's all it is you know it's all about telling people the truth protecting your own interest protecting your family the community the people that you love you know the the world you grew up in it's hopefully is is going to remain you know at least look at least tangible at least understandable because I I think man I'm so I'm going to sound old when I say this it must be confusing to be young nowadays with all this internet and this and that and all these different ideas and all this garbage on Netflix and YouTube and you're being told one thing at school another thing at home and it must be scary to be 10 or 11 or 12 years old well yeah because you have so many these kids have so many distractions at their fingertips that we really never had I never had this grown up oh he has ADHD no he's used to having fun video games all day every day now you want him to stare at a book that's not ADHD that's a lack of discipline and constant endless entertainment that's what that is and let me ask you this this is a thing what do you think about every kid getting a trophy for something whether they achieve something or not especially in sports oh well that's that's how they that's how they pound individual exceptionalism out of the populace right you're a bad person if you win now if you win too much you're a bad person MH it's better if you know everyone wins participation they just don't want anybody to wake up and understand that the unfortunate reality of the real world outside of your little classroom is that there are winners and there are losers that's the reality of the world that's how it works everything you've ever wanted in your life that woman you want other men want that car you want other men want that house you want other men want and the guy who has it won the guy who didn't lost and that's how it works it's a power Dynamic it's constant and endless competition that's how the masculine world is and I guess one of the easiest ways to attack and damage masculinity is to remove our Competitive Edge exactly what as a man you wake up I mean I I'll tell you right now I don't buy the fastest Ferrari to drive any faster I just want the fastest one the showroom MH the guy doesn't build a bigger yacht to have an extra 10 foot of deck he doesn't care he wants the biggest yacht in the marina that's how men are and that's what built the entire modern world I want to be the first one to march across Antarctica even if I risk freezing to death because my name will go down in history that's what men were and if you're going to remove competitiveness yeah what are you taught if you're taught not to compete if it doesn't matter if we're all on the same level what are you taught how can you have a man who's a man who is not interested in competition of any kind okay Financial or at least success any kind of succcess if you have a man who's not a competitive man you don't have a man at all exactly thank you sir okay till next time when I interrupt your paper well that's okay we'll do it we'll get it done it was better than what I saw in the paper today that's for sure
