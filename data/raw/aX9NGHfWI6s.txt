I have to ask you this where I'll be in trouble my nephew is a huge fan of yours he's a soccer player he was actually going to Manchester and when he heard that I was seeing you he went crazy him and all of his friends all these 16-year-olds but if you give them a shout out what's the name his name is will will take care of yourself train hard become extremely successful stay off the street stay out the clubs don't go down any of that mess you're at the height of your energetic powers and it should all be focused in the correct direction you'll be glad you used it correctly when you're older wishing you the best of success and hopefully May one day in the future I'll be in Manchester hopefully maybe we'll grab a coffee or something
