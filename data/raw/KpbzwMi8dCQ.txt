when you smoke cigars you got a like a like a feeling from it like is there something in this cigar that makes you like either light-headed or buzzed or something like that or not I've always wondered that I've never tried a cigar before um I think if you smoke really big cigars and when you're new to Cigars then yeah you do get you do you can feel light-headed yes but I've been smoking cigars for a while so for me it's more just uh I'm allowed one Vice right I don't take any drugs I've never taken a drug in my life I've never tried weed I've never tried cocaine I've never tried a single drug in my life ever never tried one I've never taken steroids ever I've got pure blood I ain't been hit up with any random injections of the last few years let's leave it at that so my my advice is I enjoy smoking a cigar I enjoy vodka sometimes and that's it
