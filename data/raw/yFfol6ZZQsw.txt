life is a NeverEnding series of tests and battles 80-year war and there is Battle to win every single day the best thing you can do is prepare for the future battle because you can be sure as you are that the sun will rise that a battle will come tomorrow's problems are guaranteed but if you do not fix today's problems you do not earn tomorrow's problems because problems in and of themselves are a blessing there is nothing worse than living in the Eternal still The Ether of insignificance where you have no problems you don't have the problems but you also do not have any innate chance it is stagnation which is destructive for the male soul is perhaps the most destructive thing you don't want that life you want to not live in a zoo there's a reason why animals die when they live in a zoo they just sit lay around wait to be fed but they don't live as long as they do in the wild because it it's the problems that keep their soul alive the fact they must avoid their predators and enemies they have to find somebody to mate with that is what keeps the masculine Spirit Alive you must change your attitude towards problems and see them as a blessing if you do not get to enjoy today's problems and solve them you're going to have no problems tomorrow and I guarantee you that life you dream of with no problems doesn't exist because if you ever do find that life it is torturous the one thing that we all have in common black or white rich or poor the one thing I can guarantee you that all of us will face male or female is a storm storms are built into God's plan and if you will follow his voice you will get to the other side God created us to learn there's only two ways to learn things the hard way or the harder way I think we're here to struggle and to learn I don't think we're here to be happy and someone goes oh but I want to be happy why why do you want to sit there and laugh like you you were happy your entire childhood it's all over now right you you're a man you have responsibilities I think we're here to do important things and important things are going to be difficult well also there's no light without dark and there's no joy without pain you can't have a rainbow without little rain and it came to pass no matter how Fierce no matter how devastated no matter how terrible no matter how many lives were lost families were lost it still comes to pass I've had some tough storms and I learned that what I have to do is be steady in the storms can I talk to you this morning you if your perspective doesn't change you will misunderstand that God allowed the storm to give you an experience that nobody else ever got to have you want uncanny influence inur an uncanny storm and this is not a time to fight and this is not a time to give up and this is not a time to die handle the upcoming Winters don't wish away the winters that's called naive wish for the skills wish for the strength wish for the wisdom and I think it's much better to just adopt a very disciplined stoic mindset if I lost all of my money today I would be the same happy but as long as I'm alive and the people I I care about and love are alive and as long as God gives me the honor of doing my duties and providing for the people I care about then then I'm I'm a vessel of God and I'm happy enough to survive that's that's all I look at it as I don't ever consider how do I feel I have things to do if you want to feel happy inside of yourself and you want to feel content and you want to feel stable inside of yourself you need to live true to God you have to be a good person God won't give you anything you can't handle this is not just a comforting phrase It's a profound truth whatever you're facing right now no matter how heavy it feels no matter how impossible it seems you have the strength within you to endure to overcome and to rise above it life has a way of testing us it throws challenges heartbreaks and struggles at us that seem unbearable there are moments when you may feel like giving up moments when you think why me but in those very moments you must remember this God has a plan for you and every challenge you face is part of your growth the struggles you face are not punishments they are lessons they are opportunities for you to discover the depths of your strength and the power of your resilience God sees the potential in you even when you can't see it in yourself he knows what you're capable of and he allows challenges into your life to reveal that capability to you think about it if everything in life were easy how would you grow how would you learn how would you discover the incredible power that lies within you it's in the tough times the hard battles and the darkest moments that you find your true self remember this every storm you face has a purpose it may not make sense right now but trust that God knows what he's doing he's shaping you refining you and preparing you for something greater when you feel overwhelmed when the weight of the world is on your shoulders don't ask why it's happening to you instead ask what is God teaching me through this ask how can I grow from this because the truth is the challenges you face are not meant to break you they are meant to build you you are stronger than you think sometimes God allows you to go through hard times so you can discover your strength he's showing you that you can stand firm that you can rise and that you can overcome each time you face a challenge and push through it you come out stronger wiser and more prepared for the next step in your journey think about the moments in your life when you've overcome something you thought was impossible at the time it seemed unbearable didn't it but you made it through you're still here and if you could handle those challenges you can handle this one too God doesn't make mistakes he knows what you're going through and he knows you're strong enough to face it trust that he is with you every step of the way guiding you strengthening you and caring you when you feel like you can't go on but here's the thing you have to do your part god provides the strength but you have to take the steps you have to keep moving forward even when it feels impossible you have to trust that the pain you're feeling today is shaping the person you'll become tomorrow faith is not about having all the answers it's about trusting the process it's about believing that God has your back even when life feels uncertain it's about knowing that no matter how hard things get you have the strength to face it because God wouldn't have allowed it into your life if you couldn't handle it challenges don't Define you how you respond to them does when life gets tough you have two choices you can let the challenges defeat you or you can rise above them choose to rise choose to believe in yourself and the power of the God who made you God sees the big picture he knows the end from the beginning he knows that what you're going through now is preparing you for something greater you may not understand it now but one day you'll look back and realize that everything you went through was necessary for your your growth your purpose and your destiny so don't let fear doubt or pain stop you don't let the weight of the world Crush you remember that you are stronger than you know and you have a God who believes in you even when you don't believe in yourself every obstacle is an opportunity every setback is a setup for a comeback every test is preparing you for a testimony trust the process trust God and trust yourself when life feels overwhelming turn to him pray for strength for guidance and for peace and then take action take one step then another and keep going because as long as you keep moving forward you're winning the battle You Are Not Alone God is with you he's walking beside you caring you when you're weak and cheering you on when you're strong he believes in you he knows your potential and he knows that you can handle whatever comes your way so whatever you're facing right now hold your head high stand firm keep fighting keep believing because you are stronger than you think braver than you feel and more
