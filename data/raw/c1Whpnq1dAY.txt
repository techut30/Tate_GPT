even the idea that I don't believe in these things I didn't correctly if you believed it I asked you if you're going to get married one day absolutely you'd like to if I'm not married already I would I will be married one day if I'm not you might be secretly married I could be married correct why would you not tell me either way why would I advertise to the feral Psychopaths of the world who have tried their very best to destroy me for an opinion about my private life and the things that are most sacred to me well I think if you said you were married if I would teach you I don't like people hate me it's about me understanding that I'm a hard target but I am very very protective of the people I care about right but you believe in the concept of marriage completely that's what we were talking about the whole time what do you think we talked about a man giving a woman away I believe in marriage more than anybody I believe in marriage no please I believe in marriage in the traditional sense I believe a man has a duty to stand up and be a real man I believe that the problem with the world today that we are facing is that not enough men are sticking to the age-old ways of masculinity I believe that me standing up and saying a man must protect a woman and provide for her so he needs to make sure that she's safe he needs a degree of authority no problem with no but no you but people do have a problem with sure I don't have a problem with what you just said here's where my problem comes right there are a lot of clips of you floating around on the internet as you know one of them has you saying bang out the machete boom in her face Ripper by the neck shut up in another you say slap slap grab choke shut up sex when people see those clips and hear you say those things agree well I don't think that there's a whole bunch of men in the world who understands my value and if if men grow up to be like me you're gonna have a whole bunch of people with no criminal record dedicated athletes who protect and provide for the people close to them are fantastic for the economy and we're and I'm not I'm certainly not the worst influence out here peers you have little Nas twerking on the devil on music videos which our children are digesting you have uh drillar is singing about stabbing people to death in the middle of a knife crime epidemic you have rabid uh Psychopaths on whether the right or the left announcing violence on the other side you have all these insanities in the world and because I sit here and say I yeah perhaps now you've laid out and it offended you I understand okay cool I just read you the things you read things that you said they could be offensive and some people are offended well some people definitely were offended absolutely that's fine and honestly I think some of the things you said were genuinely offensive a misogynist okay so they offended you so like I said earlier so they offended you which is fine I said they offended you you interrupted me and now you're saying they offended you which is fine and the but the point I'm trying to make is this I'm not the devil there's certainly worse people than me core tenants for the people who don't understand me are self-accountability so I'm accountable for everything I've ever said my core tenants are responsibility so I'm responsible for everything I've said my core tenants are traditional masculinity to a degree which involves protecting and providing for women and I'll make another Point another Point here that's very very that's very that needs to be said the number of women who have stood up and stuck up for me is ignored thousands of women are making videos saying I've met entertain such a nice guy I wish I had a man like Andrew Tate who felt responsible to protect and provide for me you know what I I do belong to my husband that's why I married him and I love him we ignore the thousands of women who stood up and prep and and stood by me and said everything I said is true and we're taking a very vocal minority who have taken things I've said and are pretending to be absolutely not really devastated by them for some reason time out sure you've had a good a good phase Ripper by the neck shut up  in another you say slap slap grab choke shut up sex when people see those clips and here you say those things agree well I don't think that it's not hard to misunderstand it it is you might say that it's consensual other people would say whether it's consensual or not that's a very ugly way to talk about women completely now that's hitting them with machetes no watch the whole video it's a girl coming at me with a machete and me saying here slap the machete out of her hand she's attacking me so you don't understand this is the exact point no people don't watch them in full and this is actually what's interesting and please don't interrupt me on this point social media has changed in Modern Times YouTube five years ago was five six seven eight minute long videos now we have Tick Tock 10 seconds 15 seconds 20 seconds YouTube shorts Instagram stories now anything you produce as long form is cut down to very very short form they're interested in clicks they're interested in engagements they find the most they find the most controversial Clips they can and on purpose you benefit given that you know it can be misunderstood do you regret saying things like this on camera where it can be disseminated by less intelligent young males who think that is actually what they should be doing to women and finally we get to the point of the issue which is the point I tried to make at the very beginning when I made a video before I was famous that got 500 views me being concerned that one percent of people will misunderstand it was not relevant we're not you start getting five million views of video 50 million views of video one percent of people misunderstanding doesn't change no it doesn't but it becomes a much larger problem so with great Fame that's true comes great responsibility right so I agree I'm famous do I say things the same way as I did back before I was famous absolutely not right as neither would you or nearly any other famous person on the planet once you become famous you have to be a lot more careful with how you say things I understand so my logical follow-up to that remains do you regret them saying it the way you said it I can't live in regret by saying something before I was famous on a camera which barely anybody watched and then I became famous afterwards that would be a very asinine way to view the world you can't live in do you stand by all those I can't live in regret because I didn't know I was gonna become the most famous man on the planet that that regret would be the wrong word is it on is it inconvenient sure but I can't sit here and say I wish I knew six years ago I'd be the most famous man on the planet and monitored all of my speech forever that's asinine it was also I think quite a disturbing piece that BuzzFeed did and he talked about the the negative impact of young impressionable male Minds when they've read or seen some of the more inflammatory things you've said and they quoted for example Sandy uh 22 from Washington my father's gone from a man who minded in women's studies in college kind and in touch with his emotions treated all people men and women around him in kindness to a man who says that whenever he sees an effeminate male stranger he gets an overwhelming urge to murder loves podcasts he listens a lot of podcasts I know he's listened to Andrew Tate let's stop for a second let's be professional here appears because you're a professional assignment firstly she said did you say that my father went she said my father has a father that's a full-grown man firstly so we're talking about my impact on children you just talked about full-grown man here secondly I've never talked about murdering a feminate men and anything online ever on in any context ever so I don't know why they have taken some random person I've never met in the world who's full grown an adult and come to their own conclusion so I've never met and lumped his name in with mine that is absolutely unfair on every level I didn't watch I didn't read this video I didn't read this BuzzFeed article but after hearing the first point I know it's trash that is complete garbage the reason this man believes what he believes I have seen a quote from you I said the reason I am so popular and I'm so famous is that there's a large contingent of men who don't want to wear makeup who still want to make money go to the gym be strong drive a fast car be traditionally masculine and don't want to be shamed for that and they don't want to be called toxic for that that is the reason I'm so massively famous that is what do you think of transgender people that's nothing to do with me I'm not transgender and I don't understand the issue like they do transphobic do you consider yourself up transfer well afraid uh would it kind of yeah I don't live in fear my friend I I have no problem you have a dislike your transgender people I don't know any transgender people you have a dislike of what they stand for what they are no why would I I don't know that's not my issue that's not my issue and that's actually quite interesting because when I was attacked a lot of these stupid articles like BuzzFeed because it's ridiculous that whole that first point proves anyone with a brain knows that that's garbage when they attacked me they lump a whole bunch of things in together they say misogynistic racist transphobic they just put them all together around a mixed race by the way I don't know where they get these they just get these buzzwords I completely agree so you support transgender people I I support individual liberty I'm a Libertarian so you support transgender people sure sure why not exactly yeah so but my point is as a whole you're saying that I'm saying I don't want to see men in dresses I'm saying no you support gay people sure yeah I'm saying there's a large contingent of men in the world who like the idea of the traditional masculine view of the world who feel happy when they watch 80s action heroes with big muscles and they run around and there's nothing toxically masculine about having a fast car and a beautiful girlfriend and making a bunch of money nothing at all absolutely and those are the people who are my fans but the problem is okay I'm going to interrupt you just to say this no no okay but this you're saying that I have a problem with hit men in dresses I'm saying no the people who watch my contact question you've answered yeah but the people who watch my content don't want to see men in dresses clearly I don't wear a dress that's the point why they're watching your content no they're not wearing a dress no but that's the point I'm making that's the point I was making there's a large contingent of men who are not interested in the things that's perhaps the YouTube algorithm is trying to feedback look when you support masculinity and masculine traits I'm with you right okay so you agree on manager protect and provide for a woman absolutely okay so you agree if you were walking down the street with a woman you'd be you'd be responsible with her safety uh yeah cool absolutely so if that woman wanted to walk alone I don't think I have authority over the world as we do that okay so let me ask you another question Pierce because we are professionals let's say your woman decided she wanted to take a nice little walk through the south side of Chicago at 2 A.M and she wanted you to go with her and you were responsible for fighting and dying on the spot if she was attacked don't you think you would say to her no we're not going out right now it's not safe yes okay so you'd have authority to make the decisions no it wouldn't so I would say I don't think you should if she decides to it's her own volition well if she decides you're not going to stop I have no power to stop her completely but you think you do no I don't think I Powers no I think I have power to make the decision I think no that's not something if you have the power to make the decision you have the power to stop her no because that's where we differ that's why I think it's interesting about you I don't think you really think through what you're saying I think through what I'm saying so careful but Andrew you've literally just said is that you have the power to stop no I said I don't have the power to stop her I'm not going to lock her in the room I'm saying that so she wants to go on her own then she's going okay but as a couple if we're going to sit there and decide if we're going to take this would I feel a sense of responsibility for a safety absolutely agreed absolutely power or authority to stop her doing it no no of course not so let me finish Pierce you're not going to stop her walking out the hotel of course it's her decision she's a sovereign individual my point is that usually in a couple people have you'd sit there as a team and you discuss and perhaps on certain issues the woman will know more about X and she'll decide X and the man might know more about why and he'll decide why so I'm saying if we're as a couple when we're sitting there and deciding as a couple as a team and she says she wants to take this late night stroll I'm going to say you know what I'm going to veto this one I'm going to call did you believe this is dangerous which two degree would give me in that particular scenario a degree of authority if she said I don't want to listen to you it doesn't give you Authority she says I don't want to listen to you Andrew I want to go on that walk then what can I do say well then I don't have authority I hope I wish you the best I love then you don't have authority cool then it's a semantic argument not really I think it's the complete opposite of what you said you had which was the authority no problem Pierce no problem but I think I think we actually think about what what do you believe about depression do you believe depression is a real thing I believe that feeling depressed is real I don't believe depression as a clinical disease is real no really correct you don't believe people can be clearly depressed I think PTSD is very real I've unfortunately I have some friends who suffer from that and I know that feeling depressed is real I believe that the number one power you have against these things are trying to take control of your own mind and affecting your own life I believe that is not healthy to hand over all your power and believe that depression is an outside disease that you can't affect I know that when I've had difficult periods in my life and also many of my friends like I've said suffer from PTSD and been through terrible things I've lived a very difficult life and I know people who have that the things that made them feel better is when they woke up and said you know what I'm not going to allow this to damage me anymore I'm going to take responsibility I'm going to get up and I'm going to fight this as hard as right and by the way on that I agree so my favorite speech is the Rocky Balboa okay so then we agree okay well let me explain why if someone comes to me and says I'm clinically depressed or I feel very very sad I would say the first thing you need to do is stop accepting the identity of a clinically depressed person stop accepting you have no control over this and what you need to do is stop identifying that way and let's work together to try and fight against there isn't an eminent doctor in the world who would tell you there is no such thing as clinical depression I think you'll simply Beyond I think Johann Hari wrote a book saying exactly that my friend he's not an eminent doctor no but he is I said depression wasn't real long ago and was attacked for it then Johann Hari wrote a book which is actually because he wrote about proven me right most people yeah he's a journalist sure and and my point is that a lot of people who are clinically depressed are suffering with something in their life and if you fix the problem in their life perhaps they won't feel depressed no that's not a disease but Andrew not situational Andrew You're simply wrong if that's what you believe Pierce that's what I believe I don't believe in things that take power away there is not an eminent doctor in the world would agree with you I think you know more than doctors I can't become clinically depressed why do you know because I don't believe it I can't be haunted by a ghost if I don't believe in ghosts let's say I'm never going to die because I don't believe in it it's ridiculous perhaps but if it allows me to live a life where I feel happy again this is that little area where you lose me no I don't lose you because somebody with your following so thousands of people the thousands of people who have emailed me saying my doctor told me I was clinically depressed and it's a disease that I have got in my brain and I can't be fixed and I started listening to you and I realized that that's not the case and I can fix my own life and you're the only person who has ever helped me thousands of people that email me that exact email if you think you are single-handedly curing people of clinical depression you are living in Cloud curriculum I am reading the emails of people who I have cured of clinical depression you're reading emails from people who I I respect that you think my view is dangerous and I respect you have the right to view that to think that I think that clinical depression I actually agree with you as massively over diagnosed I've already said that PTSD is a very real thing I've already said I didn't know hang on okay again you're misquited me I I did not say clinical depression is massively over diagnosed I said that people who claim to be be depressed but don't have clinical depression I believe feeling depressed is real I do not believe it's a disease that you catch from the sky and you cannot affect I believe that no matter what happens I believe you have control of your own mind and you can fight against it I believe if you change your circumstances in your life you may feel different I'll give you a quick example I had a guy who emailed me saying it was clinically depressed and he was going to kill himself I obviously am not a psychiatrist I'm not a doctor I told him because I reply to my emails I said have you been to a psychiatrist he said yes I'm clinically depressed I've been on these pills this amount of time I've not antidepressants it doesn't work I said I don't know what to say to besides this and he said he lost his girlfriend that's why I became clinically depressed I said listen go to the gym get a six-pack first once you've got a six-pack email me again you still feel like killing yourself I don't know what else to say to you but I'd say strong body is a strong mind GO train he went he started sending me progress pictures emailing me him getting better better shape and eventually got six-pack he's not a professional bodybuilder and he said I can't believe I was considering that I feel so much better Etc the doctor was telling him he was clinically depressed and couldn't cure it he started taking control of his own life and now he felt better now I'm not saying it's the case for everybody I'm just saying my question disagree it's very responsible because I'm saving people's lives I disagree that if you're a die if you have if you feel depressed I disagree that you cannot affect it and change your life and take control and fix yourself and feel happier I disagree with you do you think do you think I refuse to accept that there are people out there who cannot become happy contented individuals I refuse to accept we live in a world where God has created people who no matter how hard they work and how good their life becomes can't be happy I don't accept that I accept that the universe is a very giving place and that God loves all of us and if you try your best and you work hard you can become a better person and I also will argue with you and I'll counter the point that you sitting here on your platform telling people they have clinical depression there's nothing they can do about it it's far more Davis okay well then if they have clinics no you're saying if people have clinical depression they have something to do about it they go to a doctor and they get diagnosed and they get help then I would argue the point that's something opposite of what you just said I said I would argue the point that if somebody has depression of any kind whether it's clinical whether it exists or not whether they feel depressed or not whatever that taking control of their life taking personal responsibility and working hard is always going to be the positive best thing they could possibly do for their life going forward so sitting here saying I don't believe in clinical depression you don't believe in depression no I don't I believe that people can take control and fight against things I believe in personal sovereignty right fine good so we agree no we don't yes we do no we don't know you support his right to speak about things like Sandy Hook I don't know Sandy Hook I don't know and you know what it was it was a bad shooting of school children okay but to sit and and he's actually no no let's stop for a second please don't interrupt me the here's why you're I know why you're good at your job first you interrupt people a lot which is good it's a good scale so you're right and then there you go prove me right put on podcasts with rabid leftists and and people who openly hate me is it wrong I do a podcast circuit so and I don't know everything he's ever said when somebody like I don't know what so I don't know what you're trying to say get me here because I did I didn't get a word in edgeway it's pretty it's it's a it's a lame trick if you let me get a word I will tell you let's go I'm suffering from depression and the negative effects of online content the coroner said she was exposed to material that may have influenced her in a negative way and in addition well started this depression and become a much more serious depressive illness and she's very sadly took her life that's that's absolutely disgusting right her father terrible her father's campaign for better protections against potentially dangerous social media algorithms right it says that the particularly graphic content she saw romanticized acts of self-harm normalized her condition and focused on a limited and irrational view without any counterbalance of normality first of all what is your response to that nothing to do with you yes that's the first thing yeah it is nothing to do with me the fact that a 14 year old girl took her life is truly sad the world we live in today is the world we live in the fact that something like that happened is almost mind-blowing to me that's truly that's truly sad I actually feel sad and sad to see something like that the fact that they just said this romanticizing the Gory element I don't know what she was watching some kind of suicide videos that I don't know where these things you think the tech companies should be much tougher about stuff like this I don't know what kind of things she watched obviously I have to be a professional here I think that the tech companies need to do their best to protect people I guess to a degree but it's a slippery slope isn't it and then they use this slippery slope to to silence some people and to do right and I think that's a I think it's a really fine line and it's a complicated line it is very I was interested when you did an interview with the time across that line no I haven't and I and this is the thing and I've been vilified not because of the things I say because much more extremist content already exists on the internet I think the reason I've been attacked and vilified is because of the popularity because I became so massively famous not because of what I was actually saying so as a professional I analyze that and I understand that okay I'm massively famous now and certain things have been taken out of context however I still do believe I'm a Force for good in the world and I'm not going to sit here have you changed though I don't it's not about changing well it is we're all involved in Evolution how old are you now I'm 36 36 right I bet you're a different person to what you were when you were 26. oh that's fine that's absolutely so we all change
