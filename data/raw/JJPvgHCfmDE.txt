I have no problem suffering if the people I love are not suffering my children are taken care of the women I love are taken care of my mother is taking care of everybody around me is fine even if they've removed me from my life and locked me in a jail cell everybody I love is taken care of and is protected and is living good I must suffer because I am a man I am the head of my Empire I'm the head of the clan of course I will suffer but the people I love are not suffering this is what God has bestowed upon important men since the beginning of time
