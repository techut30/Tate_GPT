hello everyone welcome back to the second channel boy do i have some interesting news to go over today it's just come to my attention that andrew tate who you may remember from my video about the alpha male club that like insane business slash degrading slash fire bending club the guy from that video is apparently under investigation for some absolutely devious acts and i should probably say before i get into what they are be warned that this video is going to cover some heavier topics such as potentially sex trafficking and abuse so i would definitely steer clear of this video if you are if you are sensitive to those things and that is because this article from the daily beast came out that said police raid maga king of toxic masculinity which i suppose is andrew tate in human trafficking investigation if you're gonna show this canky blur it please because i don't want these [ __ ] who make this sparkling water to get any free promo i haven't really read this article yet so i'm curious to see what it says but in the video i talked about how he has this like webcam empire where he convinces women who would never do any kind of sex work to get into the webcam business and it sounded to me very abusive and manipulated and in my head while making that video i'm thinking like this literally sounds like sex trafficking but since sex trafficking is a crime and i don't want to like defame this guy who might have been running a very legitimate business i didn't want to be like this guy's a sex trafficker but uh lo and behold this dude is literally under investigation for sex trafficking holy [ __ ] i mean this is insane romanian police raided the home of prominent pro-trump online personality andrew tate this month as part of a human trafficking investigation before the april 11th raid tate was best known as a kickboxer and a vocal trump supporter in the online far right i guess i didn't realize he was such an outspoken trump supporter i mean that makes sense like given everything we know about him but i did not come across that when i was making my video about him i guess i was mostly just focused on the club and we dove a little bit into like the kind of stuff that he does on the side or like how he makes his money but yeah seth's found out a lot more about him so we'll go into that too he's got a very far-right presence on social media tate portrayed himself as a wealthy cigar-smoking playboy prompting one admirer to dub him the king of toxic masculinity but tate's treatment of women had an ugly side no [ __ ] one of his admirers actually dubbed him the king of toxic masculinity but get this he actually didn't treat women too well this is stuff that i didn't know either in 2016 he was booted off the british version of big brother over a video of him hitting a woman with a belt jesus christ dude am i allowed to even say this in a youtube video it's just crazy that like a lot of his followers probably don't know this about him i feel like a lot of people are just like no this guy just like gives dating advice and sure he's a little bit harsh sometimes but like he doesn't hate women he's not like an abuser and then lo and behold he's being literally investigated for human trafficking also six years ago was booted off a show for beating women let me see if i can find him on big brother at all i don't watch big brother so i don't i didn't know anything about this andrew tate enters the house and causes chaos yeah that sounds like some [ __ ] he would do oh there he is look at that fine specimen i am kind of curious to see him interact with other human beings because he's usually like alone surrounded by only cars the only things that truly understand him cold machines they're going to be like well who the hell's actually nominated and we knew he gets on with everyone so i think i'm not going to the second he gets around other people he's just extremely overwhelmed and can't form a sentence i'm around real women and men for the first time [ __ ] what do i do i think jackson marcos right now with the dynamics that are going on in the house i definitely think marco's going to be the best choice we don't [ __ ] people we're going to do a vote we're going to do a vote on this one yeah yeah he seems kind of shy i don't know everyone else is like interacting and he just kind of chimes in occasionally with like no we should do this oh i think no i think we should maybe this is before he got his giant ego okay anyway apparently he was kicked off because he was hitting women this march britain's daily mirror tabloid profiled him and his brother tristan tate and their romanian-based business which used webcam models to trick men into sending the brothers tens of thousands of dollars wait huh it's also like a scam business i thought it was just like webcam type uh you know sexy stuff in one video on his youtube channel andrew tate said 40 of the reason he moved to romania was because romanian police were less likely to pursue sexual assault allegations dude you're telling on yourself you're self-reporting holy [ __ ] dude literally said he's moving to a country where he won't be prosecuted for his crimes oh my god tate's unsavory activities didn't stop him from building links with the stars of the trumpian right in 2019 kate pauled around washington d.c with prominent online trump activists and conspiracy theorists he was on infowars a few times on april 27th a spokesperson for the romanian policy agency added that no one has been charged or arrested yet in the case but the investigation is ongoing okay so andrew tate apparently hasn't been arrested they just raided his house why did they raid his house video from the raid shows police officers armed with rifles milling among tate's sports cars with a neon tate logo on a wall in the background another video showed tate and his brother being shoved into vans by police officers before being driven away from their home kind of sounds like they were arrested he wasn't arrested he was just kind of shoved into a van by police and driven away to jail oh [ __ ] it's like the actual place where he films his videos am i a little bit surprised that those cars are actually there and that he like apparently does own these cars or at least like you know has possession of these cars am i a little bit surprised yeah i'm a little bit surprised that he's not just flexing am i impressed no i'm not impressed that he made this much money doing the absolute most evil thing in the world a romanian newspaper reported that the raid was sparked over reports that an american woman was being held captive at the tate house police found both the american and a romanian woman in the building during the raid according to their report well that seems pretty cut and dry to me they got reports that a woman was being held captive and they went there and they found her no girls were found in my house and nobody was arrested tate said yeah dude i think both of those things are actually wrong it seems like allegedly a woman was found in your house and also you were escorted away from the house by police so i mean it seems like both of the things you said were not true also it's kind of funny that it seems like the only thing this dude cares about from all the videos i've watched about him is like getting attention from women and like making it seem like women are all over him all the time so i do kind of enjoy the fact that he's now trying to make it seem like women there's no women ever at my house there were no girls no girls were found at my house i never have girls in my house women hate me andrew tate appeared to address the raid and instagram pictures featuring him smoking a cigar in a staged interrogation room as faux police officers loomed over him tate added a caption officer i think we can all agree that [ __ ] love to lie this is insane i mean like honestly i'm not that surprised because the video that i made about him before really made it seem like he was a sex trafficker and it turns out that that might be becoming true let's see if we can find him talking about this on instagram i'm curious what his comments are from like his supporters okay so i guess he's in a fake interrogation room smoking cigars this post has 37 000 likes the top comment is real g can't break the unbreakable oh my god he's got stans dude he's got like andrew tate's logo as his profile picture and his username is tate ism everyone's commenting real g big g is that like andrew's nickname everybody calls him big g what does that stand for none of his fans seem turned off by this this is very disturbing yeah they do they do lie they like they love to lie that's why i moved to romania actually because i know that women are gonna try to lie about me so much that i actually have to move countries where no one will believe them i cannot believe you took pictures okay well obviously this isn't the actual interrogation room dude this is like the stairwell of an apartment building or something these are obviously staged it's not obvious to stupid people people are obsessed with this guy what the [ __ ] in front of a mcdonald's i have a bugatti the big man people just listing foods the big mac someone else comments hash browns people are trying to order things from andrew taylor fries french fries okay hold on i think i i've just found the first negative comment on an andrew tape post it's in front of mcdonald's and someone says why are you even advertising this bs why are you advertising mcdonald's dude and people are commenting under i'm hoping he owns a few franchises otherwise i have no idea you guys are upset he's in front of a mcdonald's that's what pisses you off this dude had a woman in his house being held captive allegedly and all the comments under that post were like hell yeah brother you know in all of the other posts he's also promoting a bs business but it's his bs business it's his webcam scamming empire you guys aren't upset about that at all mcdonald's oh [ __ ] them they feed people it actually does seem like his interrogation posts did underperform this has 37 000 likes most of his other posts have like 43 000 likes so maybe he did lose a few people with that one but then they came back for the subsequent post they were like i don't know about this man but hell yeah he's walking in the desert hashtag top g he's big g he's cool g he's top g he's smart g now i gotta google insulting words that start with g negative words starting with g what can i call this fool goofy that's what the g stands for goofy you absolute ass you literally own g like the letter g was made for you yeah you are literally such a goofball dude you are so goofy and silly i remember seeing some tick tocks of him that were insane too here's here's one a lot of people ask me andrew why do you have a machete next year and my answer oh my god did i just like that on it oh [ __ ] dude that did not mean to like that a lot of people ask me andrew why do you have a machete next year and my answer's simple why wouldn't i have a machete uh i don't know maybe if you weren't like involved in a bunch of illegal businesses that would be one reason that you wouldn't need to keep a machete under your bed maybe if you were nice to people you didn't have to worry about people coming into your house to kill you those are just a few things i could think of why don't you have a machete because i'm just a youtuber i'm not you know holding people captive in my house really not weird in fact there's at least one depending on the room between one and three machetes hidden in every single room in my house he says that's not weird and then goes on to make it even more weird no it's not weird because i actually have hundreds of machetes in my house it's not weird cause i'm actually extremely paranoid some [ __ ] ass dude once said to me yeah but if it's next to your bed what if you like upset a girl and she catches you cheating and gets a machete bro there's no female alive calling women female excellent that would stand a chance against the immense power i possess the immense power he possesses bro thinks he's a super villain bro is a super villain bro he's a superhero bro whoa is that the real mike tyson oh did this video get taken down oh this one was so funny it was about him how he can't read [ __ ] where'd that video go let me see if i can google it andrew tate doesn't read stop reading books reading makes you stupid andrew tate on reading books yes please tell us andrew please tell us how you got so smart reading books is a very cheap way to i guess entertain i wouldn't call it entertainment because my brain is far too advanced i'm too smart to read yeah you can tell from those big brother clips how smart this guy is everyone's talking and he's just like oh yeah you're too smart to read what does that even mean you can't be too smart to do things you can be too dumb to do things but being smart makes you able to do more things it unlocks new possibilities you'd be able to read newer like more interesting things that would like expand your brain in different ways what the [ __ ] are you talking about i need action i need constant chaos in my life to feel content i need to be driving a supercar and [ __ ] fighting yeah dude dumb people drive and fight i don't think so they read i can't just sit there oh oh and the pirate on the boat the pirate on the boat that's the only book you could come up with yeah i think you were reading a book for like six-year-olds i could understand that not being mentally stimulating for you actually for you i for you i don't know yeah i mean if you couldn't even make it through that then i understand why you don't like reading and the saddest thing is when i googled this you see these are all posted by like tate fan accounts tate speech which i think is his account hate aikido masculine excellence these aren't people making fun of him these are people posting clips to be like hey guys the new tate just dropped he says don't read anymore don't even read the title of this video just click just look at it click it and then fight the video get in your car play the video while you're driving really fast and then just start punching your phone that's how you get smart nothing is stopping me from becoming batman nothing i have a bat cave okay yeah charismatic i'm charismatic sorry i'm just gonna keep playing the clip over and over of him sitting in the room like oh i'm charismatic dude i'm suave with the women all right when i'm in a room everybody knows my presence and i don't just sit there silently like the one time anyone's ever seen me in a room with other people how i did back then that that's not how i do it man i'm charismatic nothing's stopping him from being batman i mean he is rich and does have cars and [ __ ] but i think there is something stopping you from being batman and that's why you're not batman right you're not actually out like fighting crime helping people trying to make a difference in the world so there is something stopping you i understand why it's kind of hard for you to put your finger on it but it's your personality it's like the way you view the world that's what's stopping you because you're right someone with your amount of wealth and charisma should be using all of those things to help people but instead you have a podcast where you talk [ __ ] about women and you have a business where you exploit women and use all of the money for your own personal gain so i think you know if i could help you out for a second and just like point to the thing that's stopping you from becoming batman it's just like it's just you it's just who you are oh and the top comment here says hair yeah that too oh people in the comments arguing about how rich he is yeah bro he's not that rich and then the person who posted this video said a hundred million plus lmao definitely not yeah batman is a hundred billion dollars batman owns satellites i don't think tate can afford that yeah that's true i mean even if this dude is rich he is not as rich as batman is how much is andrew tate worth anyway now i'm curious this website says 20 million this website says 30 million i honestly actually don't think you could swing it i don't think you could be batman 30 million dollars you know batman has like military-grade equipment you know how much like one military thing costs military stuff costs so much like everything costs a billion dollars i feel like how much a tank costs okay so if you want the batmobile that's basically a tank that's gonna run you six million dollars that's already a fifth of your net worth dude the batman suit i mean that's gotta be another million dollars there's so much r d that goes into this stuff too also batman keeps his identity secret there's no way you could do that you would be bragging about it constantly all right well anyway that's that's all i wanted to cover in this video i just wanted to do a quick update thank you for watching sorry if this wasn't very funny i just thought it was kind of a necessary update to the video so um yeah thank you for watching and goodbye
