intentionality as a father if you're intentional one day my dad before I'm having kids I'm having a conversation with them I'm like listen for many years I saw you once a week I calculated how many days I saw my dad from the day I was born till I was 18 years old it was like 500 Days really I only saw him 500 Days it was once a week and then when my parents got a divorce in Germany I never saw him never even talked to him once for 18 months and when I came here they got a divorce Isam once every other week for one day so you're talking about what 26 days a year 26 days here for 5 years due to math I've seen the guy 500 Days from 0 to 18 he's my hero he lives with us right I asked him I said do you regret any of it he said not at all I said why not I said look at the man you are today you're independent you're a leader you're all this other stuff but let me tell you something here that I think Vin and Adam you guys going to get emotional when I play this clip have you seen what Jean Hackman said about his father no Jean Hackman just died at had 95 years old nominated for five movies five Oscars right I think he won two of them phenomenal actor I don't think anybody disputes how great of an actor he was his house were one time at Pebble Beach the guy says that's Jee Hackman's $30 million house this is like 12 years ago he's asked here about his father in this interview he's 78 years old I want you by the way did you even know I was going to play this clip Rob did you show him the clip or they haven't seen the clip who 78 so Jee Hackman died at 95 this is him at 78 this is years ago 17 years ago the interviewers a great interview this Insider actor Studio do a great job he asks him about his dad who walked away at 13 years old look how this 70 78y old ala winner reacts to that question go ahead Rob how old were you when your father left um well my dad left us when um I was about 13 I guess was it easy hard no it was tough tough I've read that there was a sort of casual wave goodby yeah I was down the Street uh playing with some guys and um he drove by and and kind of waved and um that was it but you saw him occasionally presumably huh uh were you close to your mother yeah excuse me did life change radically it's only been 5 years or something wow wow still effect 78 that that pause I know that he pictured that moment with his friends and his dad just going peace out and and that's beautiful and I miss I mean I'm about to cry now because I miss my father every single day but but I but but I haven't left my children and I'll never leave my children and I'm there for my children and you said a very important word there you said intentionality I think that's important because if my sons come over for two days for those two days is very intentional parenting it's very focused it's very directed I would argue that Andrew Tate for two days focused and directed will be a better influence on boys than 12 hours a day every day for most of these normal dudes sitting around on the couch ignoring their kids so we have to also keep in mind intentionality and potency and we also have to keep in mind Financial capability Elon Canen rais 14 children he can simply afford it I can simply afford to have 14 kids these kids are not abandoned in any way I speak to them on the phone every single day I see them all the time two three four times a week so this is just another attack Vector that's used against me because you know it's hard to call me stupid and it's hard to call me broke and it's hard to call me unsuccessful so the easiest attack Vector on me is to call me a bad person so they s simp simply say Andrew Tate's bad well why is he bad oh because uh he doesn't see his kids how the [ __ ] do you know how the [ __ ] do you know oh because he he hates women says who oh I made a joke sure I made a joke I hate women well how come I have so many uh women around me if if I hate them and I'm such a bad person I'm so mean oh but he was accused Accused by who Romania like this is all garbage right there's nothing I enjoy more than being a father I love being a father and I love raising my children I think it's the most beautiful thing on the planet I always say to people there's nothing more important than having kids I advocate for it all the time and I would argue Elon does the same but I'm also a full-grown man with a mission to complete and I have lots to do and sometimes I cannot be sitting at home with the kid playing kid things because I have to do big important things and my son will call me after he's finished karate and he's beat some kid's ass and I'll say good job you're living up to the Tate name now I have to go beat the prosecutor's ass and we're warriors and I'll see you in two days the jet will be waiting see you soon son and everyone's going to attack me and insult me and that's fine but is that very interesting what your father said about who the man you are today right can't you judge by results isn't that isn't that how we're supposed to operate anyway the whole scientific method is you do XY Z what is the outcome so your father did what he did to make you who you are I saw my father about the same and I am who I am and I see my kids more than my dad saw me and also I have a lot more financial capability and fame and influence than my dad had and he managed to raise me one of the most influential people on the planet so I'm very sure my kids will be fine and all my haters and detractors the little Pastor in Nebraska who thinks he's a tough guy I would argue and I State I State this this is not hyperbowl I would argue that my sons will beat your sons in any competition you can name my children are smarter than yours and they'll beat the [ __ ] out of your boys and I I [ __ ] guarantee it and I'll also guarantee in 20 years from now you're gonna see the UFC roster Tate Tate Tate t t so you can hate me all you want but when the results are world champions when the results are endlessly influential males which continue to fight The Matrix as I grow old you it doesn't matter what you say what matters is the end result and my children are being bred for war my sons don't do what your sons do Mr Pastor my sons don't scroll YouTube aimlessly my sons don't go to school and be programmed with garbage my sons spend 12 hours a day every day preparing for their future life which is going to be similar to mine nothing but heartache and stress and War my son's ready to go jail now at 5: let's not put the 5-year-old in jail date they're ready at 5 at 5 they're like yes sir if if they say I have to go sir yes sir yes sir my children I could say to my sons sit down and I can tell them to sit down in quiet without an iPad without a TV and they will sit still for five straight hours and just sit there cuz I told them to they understand this is my world and you're being raised in it I watch other children without an iPad they're throwing a fit won't eat their food this garbage all these people want to accuse me of being a bad parent look at your look at your [ __ ] kids my kids are quiet on planes my kids are in a row my kids are saying yes sir no sir my kids are quiet on command my kids don't need entertainment my kids are perfect and I'm not just saying that as a father I guarantee you when you next see me and my children you'll be like he wasn't lying my kids are soldiers so don't worry about my children worry about yours and if you really believe if you really believe that I'm a bad parent and you're better than me I'll tell you what your son and my son can meet in the cage what's that 5-year-old kids in the cage 5 10 15 20 60 doesn't matter you tell me when your kid is ready and my kid will beat the [ __ ] out of yours and I'll beat the [ __ ] out of you anytime any place father son Royal Rumble call day any time any place father son I will get that Pastor by his neck and I will show him I will show him a man I will get that Pastor by his neck and finish him and my son will do the same to his offspring I Pat I want to hear the rest of your list because you went to one and then he's start doing five-year-olds in cages I will finish them t t do you believe in hitting your kids I believe in life there is a line in which violence appears I want to make this very clear because people are going to try and misinterpret it I do not believe in abusing children I do not believe in beating children at all but I believe in life there is a line in which violence appears and this this is true for everyone people often say shouldn't hit girls so yeah you're right shouldn't hit girls I'd never hit a girl say well that's not necessarily true I'm sure if a girl turned up and set your house on fire and then killed your dog and then tried to stab you you'd push you do something right I mean police officers shoot women when they charge at them with knives like nobody is off limits to violence there is a line that if you cross violence appears now do I hit my kids no cuz I don't have to but would I sure if I say you better stop and he disobeys me you better stop he disobeys me I'm a man and you're a child and I'm about to show you why you don't want to find out this is your last warning if he defies me he is crossed the line where violence will appear will he be hurt no will he suffer bruises and will he you need to go hospital of course not he'll be absolutely fine but he will learn that there's a line now now we all know that as men we all know if I get in your face and keep talking too much sooner or later we're going to fight we all know that right so why how can I raise boys and not prepare them for the real world the real world that that we live in not the false world that women want to live in not the false world that liberals want to live in in the real world if you run your mouth sooner or later you're going to get checked so you have to be prepared to fight for every single word you say or don't say it and I think it makes me a good father to make it clear to my boys that if you want to talk tough that's fine but there will be consequences now if you beat me up if you beat me then you can keep talking if you beat me if you beat me then you can talk you want respect you want some of this yeah I'll say to him look I've given you an opinion you given me your opinion it doesn't seems there's an impass here looks like we have to looks like we have to go kinetic sir so if you beat me then you can continue to tell me you want Cheerios but I've said there's no [ __ ] Cheerios so it is what it is so the answer truthfully respectfully would I hit my children if they cross the line yes am I a Psycho no have I had to hit my kids thus far no but man one of the main reasons I don't have to hit them is because they know I would let's let's let's analyze this this is important one of the reasons I don't have to hit my kids is because they know I would one of the reasons the police don't have to shoot you is because you know they would if you know the police would never shoot you you wouldn't comply you comply because you know there is a threat of violence at the end of it it and anyone there's a lot of people who are antiviolence right people go oh violence is bad guys wake up violence is the underpinning of civilized society violence runs everything this world we currently live in is run by violence why am I returning to Romania on the 23rd of March because if I don't they'll put out a piece of paper it's just a piece of paper what could a piece of paper do to you well that piece of paper means guys are going to come get me and who are those people why don't I tell them to [ __ ] off because if I do they will become violent that piece of paper has power because it is backed by the threat of violence a police officer has power because it's backed by the threat of violence and a father has power because it is backed by the threat of violence my sons know if they disrespect me there will be consequences what do you think you owe them what do you think you owe your kids it's a really good question let me quickly analyze if I owe them or if they owe me because I feel like they owe a lot to our last name I feel like they're heavily indebted already I feel like they owe me and they owe my father and they owe our last name and they owe our bloodline I feel like they owe me I owe them the best chance they can be to be them their best selves of course I do and I am heavily interested I am father of the year anyone who thinks I'm not a father I guarantee you I spend more time micromanaging my son's upbringing to make him a hero than you can possibly believe so I do have a duty to them to give them the best possible chance but they have a duty to me to not squander it uh my children have a massive burden over their head which is the Tate name and people often say oh oh you know it's bad to have a a father who you're trying to live up to D I mean I'm sure loads of psychologists say this but they're all they're all liars anyway who psychology doesn't work they've never cured anybody ever so psychology is garbage and therapists are garbage and Liberals are garbage and what women think about raising boys is garbage too that's all garbage I think the best thing that can happen for a boy to be raised into a kingdom and look up and say [ __ ] dad's the [ __ ] man I gotta be like Dad this is hard oh it's a burden to Performance oh does that make you feel stressed welcome to life son cuz guess what I have a burden to Performance I have a burden of performance in that courtroom I have a burden of performance after a 12-hour flight to get off the Jet and walk out to the media and deal with them I have a burden of performance permanently and endlessly so that's the real world if you're a man you have a burden of performance so I make sure that they they understand that from a very young age example C the example is what you owe them yeah everything goes no I I it's my job you know what it's actually a balancing act and I I'll be honest with you very honest with you r daughters is so much easier because with my daughters I feel like I just want her to be happy you know my daughter I just want her to be happy you want to be a princess oh you're a mermaid that's great you're a mermaid you're a princess it's Christmas you're happy you're smiling with my daughters I just want them happy but with my sons it's far more detailed because I don't want my sons to be happy as much as I want them to be capable I don't want my sons to be miserable of course but I don't wake up and think I just make him happy I do with my daughters I'm the worst I'm a girl with a girl Dad she wants a toy give her the toy mhm oh he wants a toy he wants what what what does he want how many push-ups is he done what do you mean toy what toy K bring him here and I get mad because with your sons you're far more you have to prepare them for Life as a man it's harder it's yeah it's hard to be a man so I have a duty truthfully I think to my sons the hardest thing is for me not to be a soft as I want to be oh like with with my daughter with your daughters you get to just be yourself and everyone thinks that I'm a big mean evil man but you'll often know if you've been through enough life that the mob bosses or the big evil man we're the softest guys we're I'm So Soft with my daughters and with my kids and sometimes with the boys it's hard to be hard on them but you have to be it's my duty sometimes to harden my heart
