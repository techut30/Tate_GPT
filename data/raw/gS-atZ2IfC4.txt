what the secrets to success there is no secret to success I have the secret to my success and the secret to my success is different from the secret to everyone else's success if you take a hundred people and put them in a room all millionaires all of them worth 10 million plus and I'm sitting in that room with them and you come up to the table and say guys what's the secret to making money all 100 people will give you 100 different answers as to how they made money which means there is no secret to success there is no recipe to success I know the recipe to my success so I was 17 I was working at a fast food restaurant making sandwiches now the internet didn't really exist as such but looking back on it it was part of my journey and I regret nothing because I ended up where I am so would I even go back and tell myself anything is the question if I had to um it would be to to not burn so much of my time let's talk to the 17 year olds who are listening you know do you do you finish your job come home play Video Games Etc that's what I used to do when I was 17 a little bit what I didn't do is come home and think okay [ __ ] let's let's work on something new let's try and build something let's start a YouTube channel let's start creating content instead of consuming content um yeah I tell myself to be a little bit more proactive with my free time and not [ __ ] around so much stand yourself in front of the mirror if you are that person imagine yourself 30 years older imagine yourself fat out shape bags under your eyes wrinkles on your skin gray hair imagine that man exactly where you are today and if you don't like it do something to change it because it's complacency that damages people and that's a mix of brainwashing and programming and uh you know your personalities a mix of lots of things but I think growing up really impoverished and looking around at the other adults you know who are still in I was I was 16 17 years old working at McDonald's I was working with people who were in their 40s and 50s doing exactly the same job as me and I thought whoa this is [ __ ] I'm gonna have to do something why are you on this podcast asking me how to stop procrastinating turn off YouTube go do something what's wrong with people this is exactly what you were talking about by asking a question when you already know the answer to you know the answer is to stop doing things that waste your time and apply yourself to something important now this may not be a waste of your time but let me tell you you're a dumbass clearly it's like Googling how to get fit like you just said everyone knows what a push-up is do 10 000 of them a day stop wasting your [ __ ] time you know I've never had to deal with procrastination I've never had to deal with not being motivated because what is the alternative literally be a loser forever there is a way to get revenge on women every time any I've heard anyone say oh my ex bro got me she cheated on me I need Revenge I need Revenge that's that's sick minded that's that's in cell level [ __ ] the only kind of Revenge that you can get on a woman is this ever say goodbye politely keep working hard increase your value as a man wait three years four years six years 11 years and you know this story the 11 year story and wait till you are the man and she's just now some chick 28 29 yeah and she's like Tristan you know it should have always been you then you can either tell her no or break her heart again then you win My Success was that I trained hard I was a professional fighter I've always been confident that comes from my kickboxing I guess which made me good with women I was good with women so I always had beautiful girls around me when I realized that beautiful women could make money on webcam I'd put various girls on webcam started making a few dollars here a few dollars there until it grew into one of Europe's largest Studios then I became a millionaire that is a recipe to my success now go and ask Elon Musk the recipe to success and he's going to say invent PayPal and then make space Rockets it's it's a different game so yeah what advice would I give to a young guy I will give the only advice that I can give I cannot give any other advice besides what worked for me do a lot of physical training become attractive to women start a webcam Studio that's what made me a millionaire that is the secret to my success there is no secret to success that generally Works across the board because God knows it's not work hard in school and get a degree a healthy body is a healthy mind get into shape you know uh try to try to try to look your best try to um you know become more knowledgeable whether that be you know watching YouTube videos uh watching stuff that my brother or you put out just try to understand the world better try to understand that you know you can't just walk through the world as a dork because the things you desire don't come very freely to dorks I would like to think that every single young man watching would love to have a beautiful woman they would wouldn't they beautiful woman beautiful women don't like dorks they really don't so look at the things you want from life and look at who you are as a person and think how can I positively change myself to get the things that I want from life and I think you're naturally going to come out of your dork State just from doing that I have no ritual or anything that I actually recommend to you to men with younger men especially the guys who aren't physical yet and they don't have the size and they don't have the money to go to the gym and they don't have the time to do the training obviously Andrew sells his Fitness training program which is all well and good but a good example I always used when I was younger was do push-ups during TV commercials yeah push-ups during TV commercials was my life hack when I was young I was broke you know I obviously I got to this this size I'm no bodybuilder but I'm a very big guy I'm about 240 pounds um watching TV is a very wasteful exercise absolutely every time the commercial comes on do 50 push-ups if you can't do 25 do 10 every time the commercial comes on something yeah by the time the day's over you've done 150 push-ups you know your arms feel pumped up your pecs feel pumped up what choice do you have my friend what do you mean what happens if you don't deal with the grief I don't understand are you gonna kill yourself drink yourself into depression ruin your own life you have no choice you're on a train track and you can either change the direction of the train that goes off a cliff or you can keep it on the track time is going to still keep going on and you are going to be sad so are you going to be a sad winner or are you going to be a sad loser to me it's very binary just because everyone's doing one thing doesn't mean doing the opposite is wrong sometimes that's the best thing to do life is like a game of chess you can't take moves back all you could do is look at the board you're in look at the position you're in and make the best moves possible women are gonna want that Gucci purse when they get to 16 17 18 years of age they're gonna want those shoes they're going to want those Lubes they're gonna want the jewelry and who's going to give it to them so become a financially successful man yourself for the sake of your daughters because one way or another she's getting that Gucci purse my friend whether it's Oni fans webcam prostitution escorting sugar daddies or her actual father who loves her and takes care of her so people who think they're going to hold their household together with Traditional Values and religious values alone when you're flat broke but leave me if your daughter's pretty she ain't gonna be broke for long my friend and she isn't getting the money from you and she's not getting it for free either I am sick of reading [ __ ] on the internet saying yeah you know some people are special and they take longer to bloom and your time will come let me tell you something 99.9 of people who are born broke live broke stay broke die broke that is the reality for almost everybody the internet and there it's all gonna come to you at the right time [ __ ] is [ __ ] a psyop to keep you down you already know the answer you don't need me to tell you why the [ __ ] you asking four men who do not know you personally how to stop wasting your time I don't even know what you do to waste your time you already know the [ __ ] answer my daughter's gonna be raised very differently to my sons my son's gonna have to work hard for everything to do I'm gonna take care of my daughter within reason you know the shoes the Gucci purse the nice car she wants a little Mini Cooper or a Fiat 500 to drive around and cool I'm going to take care of you because you are a member of my family I am the man in charge of this family and I am going to provide for you when you are looking at other men in the world I'm not gonna lock her in the house I'm not gonna say don't date I'm gonna just inform her that when you're looking for other men in the world you have to understand that when you pass on from this family that's the man who's going to potentially be taking care of you listen everything's going to plan smile go live your life be a sad winner and not sad loser [Music]
