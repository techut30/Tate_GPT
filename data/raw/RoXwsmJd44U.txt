there's a lot of young men now young women that require that discipline what kind of advice would you give them practical advice yeah I think that you have to live there's a lot of practical advice I can give in terms of the religious sense I would say you need to live like God is always watching you may have the opportunity to do something bad or you may have the opportunity to steal some money or snake somebody but in the end you're going to pay for that and the bill will be paid I think if you do the right thing in my experience if you're a person who does the right thing firm handshake is on time doesn't lie to anybody does what he's supposed to do do is honest with a good heart is genuinely polite to everyone he meets if you are that person you get very far in life I have have yet to meet people who just do all the simple things right who completely fail at life but I've met a lot of people who snake or steal some money and they get really rich and they lose it all or they get rich and end up a gambling addict or depressed or Etc if you want a good Society so then you have to argue and sit and say do these people want a happy functioning Society or do they want something else I live I have to live the exact same life regardless of how I feel so me for me happiness is not a good indicator on how life should be lived you shouldn't wake up and say how happy am I today how does that affect how I act that's not how I operate I wake up and say what must be done what will allow me to be proud of myself what will allow me to achieve and those things will be done regardless of how I feel and those are how that's how the most successful people on Earth all operate most successful people on Earth don't only do things because they feel happy about doing them the whole world doesn't give a [ __ ] if men are happy or not nobody cares about men being happy we talk about women being happy we want children to be happy if you look at a full- grown man on Christmas morning he's smiling cuz his wife is smiling he's smiling cuz his children are smiling nobody even buys them anything what do they buy the dad socks nobody cares about men being happy so why do you as a man care about you being happy that's how you're going to fall into these traps I'm a very I'm a very content person I live a fantastic life I'm not miserable or depressed I'm not sad ever but I don't wake up and go I want to be happy today no sir I wake up and say okay things must be done and those things will be completed regardless of how I feel regardless of how I feel you can lock me in a dungeon for an unknown amount of time in ROM in Romania and I will still complete as many push-ups as I can possibly do in the dark by myself what else am I going to do sit there and be sad happy or sad the push-ups must be done it's called Duty it's called honor it's called Pride if you had these things you would never do dumb [ __ ] in the first place so you have to just understand that God is always watching he's going to reward W you in the end that's the first thing and the second thing I will say is that you are the sum of The Five People You spend the most time with and you need to create your reality I think the biggest problem with young people today is that they don't create the realities heavily enough the people that they want to spend most time with aren't adding any value to their lives and then they end up wondering why they don't get I stand in the mirror with a pure heart I know I am the best version of me that could Poss we ever exist I know that God is proud of me there's nothing that God hates more than sloth and laziness if God were to create a man and that man were to sit around and do [ __ ] all God will frown upon you it's why you're never lucky if you're listening to this and you think I'm never lucky I'll tell you why cuz God dislikes you because you're [ __ ] lazy start to work start to show God the beauty of his own Creations you'd be amazed how lucky you become God is unhappy with these people and inside their hearts they're unhappy we talk about depression anxiety all those things you mentioned in the earlier on this podcast that comes from self-loathing you loathe your own weakness you load your own laziness this is what all of these things are it's so easy to win if you can control your own mind it seems that nobody [ __ ] can if you cannot control your own mind then you are just a feather in the Wind of life because your own mind is the only thing you can control you can't control the weather you can't control other people you can't even control whether your heart stops beating you might have a heart attack tomorrow you can't control anything besides what you think if you cannot control your own own mind then you go through life with zero control zero influence you can't control anything you're just a feather in the wind waiting for life to blow you from happy place to sad place to happy place to sad Place completely hoping on the gods to be fortunate to you because if any genuine discomfort comes your way you're [ __ ] it is trained like everything else in life it is trained so if you find yourself not appreciating what you have until it's gone then you must blink and cure your brain if you find yourself unable to f Focus or concentrate on tasks you must blink and cure your brain if you find yourself unable to go and dedicate yourself to something you don't want to do you must blink and cure your brain and the world we live in today it's hyper competitive and if you want to be the kind of man that has the choice of women to choose a good one you need to be an excellent man it's no longer acceptable for you to just be an average Joe or below average you have to get up and you have to work hard and you have to be smart and interesting and you have to be charismatic and make some money and be in good shape and you have to try very hard and genuine master he's not out here to hurt people absolutely the opposite he's out here to protect and when bad things happen they call traditionally masculine men if you need a firefighter you need a masculine man when you call the police because of the problem you had you want masculine men and as soon as a woman or a man is in trouble when you look for backup you look for masculine men and masculine men have a duty to provide and protect those they care about we have a duty to do things we don't feel like doing because we know we're supposed to do them and that's why we stayed in the Titanic and died those were masculine men Life as a man is exceptionally difficult I say the most beautiful and the most ter tering thing about being a man is you're born without value Society doesn't care about you you're only going to be cared about based on how useful you are you have the chance to build yourself up and become a superhero if you're prepared to do the hard work and be inable enough to never quit but if you're going to stand around and wait for a handout nobody's going to ever respect you I think that a lot of people have forgotten about how difficult how competitive it is as a man we're always in constant competition with each other and it's your duty as a man to stand up and say I want to be as important and strong and good-hearted and God-fearing as possible and I need to work hard to achieve those things look at it that's how life should be you should have a duty to your ancestors I was instilled with a duty for a very long time to honor my ancestors through achep and I was told from a very young age that the only thing your ancestors are interested in was achievement even to this day when I do podcasts people repeat and talk about my father if I wasn't successful he wouldn't be spoken about anymore he Lo he died 9 years ago and he was a good chess player but no one's really that interested in chess the reason he lives on is because I'm so monumentally successful that people are interested in my origin story he is mentioned the reason I will live forever is because my son will be so mentally successful that they'll talk about how he could have been such a perfect specimen of Man how he was raised and they will mention me if you give a [ __ ] about your ancestry and if you give a [ __ ] about your family and you're not a selfish person and you want them to exist out in The Ether for reality for for The Eternity of reality it is your duty to be successful a traditionally masculine man does things he doesn't feel like doing because it's his duty to do them he charges into the bur building because it is his duty not because he feels like it because it is his duty men who do not control their emotions are dangerous if you find a man who is stoic he's not going to hurt people he's going to sit and think about his actions very carefully and he's going to be a good man who protects for and provides for his family you find a man who just acts out on impulse and does whatever he feels like you're going to find a dangerous man you need to be teaching stoicism you to be teaching young men to understand that the world is very very difficult it's hard to be a man you're going to feel bad sometimes you just suck it up and perform anyway don't just sit there you cry your eyes out this is what God wants from us from all of us it doesn't matter what the adversary is it doesn't matter how much you're hurt by it you need to allow it to motivate you to push harder and and show your power um and show your resilience I very much understood that when bad things happen to me this is a lesson from the universe or from God or from the Creator to to to stand up and show who I am and who I can be and to take all of the pain and anguish and disappointment and heartbreak and all of this and turn it into a force I can use for good and to make myself a better person and I think if you don't approach life this way that you're always going to struggle cuz life is hard for everybody it's going to be hard it doesn't matter who you are or what you do you need to be resilient to it just any man who's out there in the world today you need to look at some problems that need solving either for yourself or for society and find a way to fix them and I think that you should just adopt some problems and try and fix them it doesn't matter what it is you can just try and fix the litter in your area or you can try and get a six-pack or whatever you want so if you love your family and you love your last name and you're proud of yourself then you have a duty to be massively monumentally successful to show homage to your ancestors I find it amazing there are people out here today who are going to sit and say oh I'm sad I'm too depressed I don't want to work hard there do you understand that only 200 years ago there were peasants out working a field starving surviving the Black Death surviving the plague struggling to exist just to reproduce so that 200 years later you can be the end of their bloodline you to sit on your ass and do [ __ ] nothing like you're a [ __ ] up you're [ __ ] up your entire bloodline of your entire ancestry you owe these people things you must they went through hell for you to exist you have a debt you have a duty to pay you have to be the best possible version of yourself and to same to God God loves people who try God loves people who work hard it's amazing if you try your very best all the time what God will give you he'll give it to you anything you want if you actually try not not convincing yourself you try actually try they're different things disappearing from society it used to be like I am Andrew son of emry it was all about who you're a son of right and it's all Vanishing now but you have a legacy you can build and and I I love the fact that when I was growing up when my dad walked into a chess tournament people were scared because his name was said and they were fearful of his last name and now people are fearful of the last name again because of me and they will be again because of my son and this is this is the beauty of Life as a man and one of the most terrifying but also gratifying things of Life as a man is that we're all born relatively valous I don't think women are born that way a woman if she's born especially if she's attractive has an innate value people just want her no matter what but as a man if you're not an important man nobody gives a [ __ ] about you and they're never going to care so you have to build yourself from the ground up and that's scary for a lot of people but it's also a massive opportunity you can decide if you want to be a famous musician or a nice sensitive poet or a painter or a kickboxing world champion or a businessman you get to decide on all the different characters in the video game you can choose who do I want to be and then if you actually try actually try you can become it isn't that amazing you can wake up and go you know what I want to be this kind of guy I knew who I wanted to be I wanted to be the dude pulling up in the lambo 3: in the morning gets out everyone's like who is this big strong Rich dude I wanted to be that man so I became and and if you don't want that if you want to go PE a a musician and play guitar and get a bunch of chicks and chill and Bali and smoke wheat you whatever go you can choose your character and build it and there's also some Universal constants like if you a lot of people don't have the ability to understand the compounding effect of doing the right thing time after time even if you start a new business you don't know what to do I guarantee if you're always on time if you're a builder and you're always on time take the basic [ __ ] just be on time over time you may you may think go just on time no one notices trust me across 10 years that's the difference between being a successful Builder and not being a successful Builder stick to the absolute Basics and and do the right thing and do know what you're supposed to do and this is why I have so little sympathy for people who go I'm trying to make it and I can't cuz I think they're lying to me and they're lying to themselves they got a lot of emails a lot of messages a lot of people like bro I'm trying my best and my answer is simply no you're not I I really don't think they're trying their best I maybe I come across and I seem non-sympathetic but I'm from a council state in Luton I'm now a buire and it's because I actually tried my best a lazy person thinks he's working too hard and a successful person thinks he isn't working hard enough and we're doing 20 times the work they are and we're like I could have done more I could have done this I missed that today can't miss that again I should have taken that call I should have flown there I should have that's you know we have guilt about it they don't give a solitary [ __ ] and even if you pointed it out to them they'd sit there and go oh yeah they'd make some excuse for it it's it's the brutal arrogance of people it's like if you're not going to take any action at all after 2 hours of being educated then you're going to just stay a loser yeah 100% that's the reality
