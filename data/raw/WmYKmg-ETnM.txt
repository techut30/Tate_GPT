therapy if you've been watching my channel for long enough you know that i have a gripe with many things and i'm always right i'm eternally correct if i have a gripe with something then that something is in trouble because my logic is infallible and i have a genuine problem with therapy as a whole what is therapy well therapy is the idea that you need to go through life crying about the bad things that have happened to you to some other mortal being as if they are god and that somehow that makes things better you need to go to some other normal human with their own problems who's no better than you and sit there and go oh this happened that happened and that somehow this inaction is going to improve your life one of my largest problems with therapy is that it's an antithesis to my world view and my world view is that action always wins momentum speed power forward forward forward anyone who's done business with me knows the first thing i say is okay good idea how quickly is it done the sooner it's done the sooner it makes money if it takes two days instead of one day that's one extra day we've lost we could never make money during you want to be a millionaire do things quickly action wins therapy is not action therapy is sitting and crying and complaining talk is not action a [ __ ] chitchat is an action is it g no g knows action is doing something if you feel depressed gee you're gonna spill [ __ ] coffee and you're ruining my hate speech piss off if you feel depressed you go to the gym you do something you don't sit and cry about it and why i feel depressed let's go sit and have a talk words don't count as action not in the harsh realm of reality so that's one of the first problems i have with therapy the second problem i have with therapy is therapists don't want you to get better therapists want little piles of goo they can poke at little weak individuals they can just poke at and ask stupid questions to we're going to pay an hourly rate forever it's not in their business model to improve your life it doesn't make any sense they just want to sit there and let you just talk [ __ ] as long as it takes what's crazy about this is how can you go and sit in front of a therapist and not and not cross your mind that this this therapist has a [ __ ] life anyway all these therapists are getting divorces and cheating on their [ __ ] lives and are just as depressed as you if therapists understand psychology so well why are they all living these perfect ideal lives well they're not because they don't know [ __ ] the idea that therapy is somehow necessary or mandatory is is just new age western garbage the thing with all this new age [ __ ] is that something should be universal across the human condition if therapy was so necessary it would have been necessary forever the fact that it wasn't necessary before and is now necessary means it's new think new age and you've been conditioned to believe that you need it people survived without it for a very very long time therapy is not necessary action versus inaction therapists live in a world of inaction to sit and chit-chat and talk and discuss maybe hmm tell me when you were 12 when you that time you had that orange juice uh like who gives a [ __ ] i live in a world of action and you know what action is physical force action me standing up is real action me whooping someone's ass is real action sitting there having a chit chat and writing things down is in action therapists live in a world of inaction i live in a world of action and as i said the beginning action always trumps in action robin williams is my test case robin williams is the case people often come to me and say well depression isn't real why did robin williams kill himself well i'll tell you why therapy is why robin williams did 12 years of therapy for 12 years not only was he taking mind-altering antidepressant drugs which is a video in and of itself why i'll never do antidepressants but on top of that every single day he's sitting there with a therapist if you sit in front of someone all day every day and talk about all the bad things that have ever happened to you all day every day you're gonna feel pissed off even i would want to jump off [ __ ] bridge if i spent 12 years talking to some [ __ ] about all the bad things that's happened in my life it's detrimental sitting there crying about bad things is never going to help you if you're the kind of person who feels like they need therapy you need someone to talk to to make me feel better do you know what you are you're useless because in the harshest realities of this cold world there are people in syria whose entire family have been blown to with a bomb from the sky who are still getting up every day making bread and selling on the streets so they have enough money to buy a new pair of sandals sometime next year well you're crying about nothing with your first world [ __ ] to some therapist who probably does coke on the weekends my final point on therapy is as follows it is detrimental not only is it useless not only is it not science not only is it [ __ ] it actually makes people worse the worst thing you can do if you have a problem is sit and talk about it all day people say you shouldn't bury your problems because if you repress them that's [ __ ] world war ii how many people died did everyone sit around and [ __ ] go oh we don't have time to rebuild all the cities and and create the nhs we need to sit and talk about all the bad things that's happened every single person has a horror story from russia to germany through france england america the japanese the philippines everyone has something bad to say so let's somehow clone the entire population of earth so we have enough therapists and sit there and talk all day instead of getting [ __ ] done [ __ ] people shut up and they got [ __ ] done there's nothing wrong with [ __ ] having something bad happen to you internalizing it the best you can maybe speaking about it with someone close to you but in general just shut the [ __ ] up and get along with it therapy is detrimental if you want to learn piano you find someone who can learn piano you learn from them and you start training if you want to get rich find somebody who's rich and start training to get rich right here right now this is a brand new way anybody can make money you can only have 50 bucks i guarantee you will make money with this system hold on tight we're about to get rich right here hustlers university [Music]
