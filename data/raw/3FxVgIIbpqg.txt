[Music] where else have people who have inspired Millions who spoke against Authority ever ended up besides jail or de The Matrix is calling time's up if you look at Palestine Israel absolutely cuz it is a all my bank accounts were frozen everything was taken from me was it gradual or was it just instant woke up everything was taken now that we've removed masculin he absolutely from the West we're going to be conquered how do you see it ending I think that Andre Tate used to get nervous with women well when you're a teenager when you're a teenager I think everyone is if you understand how the world really works you're going to say things sometimes they can take and weaponize and attack you with a lot I can say about Elon I think he's done fantastic things in terms of cracking the Matrix we're reaching such a level of softness in society that people don't like the way I say things it comes across too aggressive aren't we going back to how it used to be didn't Kings have like 10 lives a version of The Matrix is always going to be to some degree necessary what would your final words be to the world hi my name is Andrew Tate and I'm one of the passionate [Music] few now let me ask you this when you were in jail obviously you're going through so much were you tripping about money I'm sure because I mean you took all this time to make you know of course people speculate on your net worth and how much you're worth and you know tens of millions hundreds of millions billion dollar valuation but it took you a lot of work a lot of time right like so much of you and Tristan and you know the whole empire you built are you tripping about money at this stage are you worried about how it's tied up or my bills will be paid for me and the people I love for the rest of my life even if I go to jail tomorrow forever so I knew that was good going in yeah I knew that was good when people say how but well yeah and I have to be careful what I say what I will think most people don't at home understand is the logistics of money and how difficult it is to move sometimes and how difficult it is to access and use the average person just sees money as I have money in my bank but that's not your money because if you annoy your bank or your bank gets a letter you'll quickly see that that money is not yours it's the banks and it's gone or if you want to take a 100 grand out like nope sorry you're not allow too much yeah exactly yeah so then you have physical cash which is being phased out you can't even buy most expensive things with cash anymore so cash isn't usable anymore so it's setting yourself up and setting up your financial structure so that money can still be access and can still be in the hands of all the people who need it and then when the Matrix is trying to get hold of all of my money they're also going to look at all the finances of the people close to me and then try and track down the money they have and you have to be prepared for that it's a job in and of itself these things and it's complicated and yeah I have to be very careful what I say but um I I knew my bills were going to be paid I knew my children were going to be okay but it's none of these things are simple they're very difficult and very complicated to do it's it's it's a a full-time job in and of itself and I'm just glad I had pre-prepared to the level I had if I hadn't then I don't know what would be going on because jail feels like a different lifetime it feels so long ago but I haven't had a penny technically on paper since that day has that humbled you in any way no nah nah I don't but but I don't need money anyway I mean it's not it's not money that makes me Brash in fact I think I'd be far worse if I was broke if you if you to take all my money off me right now and then s me down in front of a camera when I had nothing I'd be far worse I had nothing to lose then at all so it's not if they think that bankrupting me is going to make me shut up they're going to learn if they succeed they're going to be very disappointed yeah it's the absolute opposite the first thing they're going to do always is trying to hit your money MH because money what are they what are they begging America for from Ukraine right now money you want to fight a war you need money MH so if they take your money away you don't have bullets in your gun mhm that's the first thing they're going to do and the world tried taking your money away I remember you woke up one day all your bank accounts were cancelled and yeah that's right all my bank accounts were frozen everything was taken from me was it gradual or was it just one day everything instant woke up everything was taken flip switch just like that flip switch all my bank accounts in every country they could find in my name was taken overnight just like that no explanation no explanation I got some letter from the bank something about our values and some garbage some complete generic nothing you get later on so the funds were just locked up locked yeah S I still don't have them so it's been two two and a half years I don't think I'll ever get him back and there's and how did you react to that well I'm sure you were a little pissed off I was but I I expected it to happen I don't think most I it's amazing to me that there's people going through the world today who believe that the world functions how they're told it functions that they believe that there's law and there's Banks and there's regulation and this is supposed to happen this way no it's all alive everything is a lie MH and I don't think people at home understand the basic premise of if you had two teams playing basketball MH for a hundred bucks and there was no referee then people would end up cheating and breaking the rules to try and win and that's for $100 that's human nature so imagine how they're going to cheat and break the rules to control the most powerful Nation on Earth in an election or to control and influence how people think with an information War MH to think that they're going to allow somebody to sit on the internet become the most famous man in the world and say whatever he wants car counter to their narratives and they're not going to damage him is asinine you must understand that that's not going to be allowed to happen and you must understand they're going to break all the rules to damage that person somebody made a phone call and they deleted all of my social media and locked all of my banks at once and took all of my things and then the Matrix attack increased and I was arrested here in Romania they took all of my cars all my gold all my diamond watches all the property they could find everything in my name they took all of it they took it and the goal is to bankrupt me their their goal is to bankrupt me for a variety of reasons one because it prevents me from fighting back and secondly because they're trying to put a massive amount of mental stress on me it's you live inside of your mind at the end of the day it's only inside of your head that you're existing so their primary objective is to take all of your money away so that your children can't eat so the women who depend on you are calling you up crying screaming about their needs so that the staff you're supposed to pay can't feed their families so that you're in the middle of an implosion MH that's what they want they want me to be answered the phone to people saying pay my bills and I can't do it anymore and then by extension of that your circle starts to fall away and they can identify attack vectors ah well this girl who was loyal to him when we first interviewed her because her rent was being paid now has a new man and this new man doesn't like that she's Andrew's X anyway so maybe we drag her in a second time she'll say things we want her to say MH that's the primary objective MH so if you're a man who wants to tell the truth and speak opinion and understand you're going to upset powerful people you need to be prepared for all of this and you need to understand that there are mechanisms you can put in place because I'm still alive that allow you to exist financially post Matrix attack but also to make money outside of these mechanisms is a massive advantage and that's what the internet is good for I actually would argue because I was having this conversation the other day I think I'm in a quite a rare category of PE person I think that I'm quite difficult for them to attack which is why I'm so frustrating because even 8 years ago which isn't that long ago seven eight years ago right who was truly famous without gatekeeping like if you're an actor you're gatekeeper you're gate you're gatekeep if you're a singer gatekeeping yeah if like who sports star gatekeeping there was always someone you had a contract there was always someone who called your phone said what you can say what you can't say don't have this opinion that's right there's always someone who could make you disappear get you canceled kick you out the team get you can no more movies Etc then the internet came and there were some people who were big online fine but then the social media companies was G were gatekeeping for a long time but to crack that wall and to be to get bigger than The Gatekeepers to a point where they can't contain you all they have left is the legal system at that point which is why I'm in the pament I'm in but I think I'm quite an interesting category of person for them to hurt because usually when people talk like I talk they're either insignificant usually because they've been stopped so early and prevented from growth yeah or they just canceled their contract and they have to go away it's usually one of two things that happen yeah but you own your medium you own your broadcasting in a certain way and it's funny because you talked about you were the most viral person on social media before you even had a lot of Tik Tock accounts like you were the most viral person on these

e-commerce into a thriving online business today thank you to Zen drop for sponsoring this video now let's get back to the show yeah we there's been some videos that broke down how we how I became so famous how I became so known around the world but we put together an extremely sophisticated affiliate Network and the primary objective was to drive people to our own social media Network so we could tell the truth because I was upset about Co and a few other things and then that Amalgamated into understanding the people inside of our Network who want to hear what I want have to say and who want to speak the truth are also going to need to make money they're also going to need to be Matrix proof MH which is how the school evolves into what it is today yeah and yeah is it isn't it crazy we live in a world where if you have an opinion which differs from the norm whatsoever you can't even hold a job what's I do like to do thought experiments though and think would the world be better if everyone could say what they thought all of the time because sometimes I'll be honest and I admit sometimes you have to always and I think a lot of people don't do this often enough is sit and consider if they're on the right side of history and I truly believe I am absolutely on the right side of history but for me to come to that conclusion I need to sit and think about it right people don't sit and think am I the good guy because in a war the bad guys always think they're the good guys yeah that's how it works there's two good guys yeah or the bad guys will label the good guy as the bad guys frame control and and the truth is often there are no good guys and bad guys there are varying interests and different levels of good and bad and everything's a shade of gray and white but I truly believe I'm on the right side of history but you have to sit and analyze these things and I don't think people do often enough and I've come to the conclusion that we do need some degree of Matrix you do need some degree of slave minded populace you do need some degree of societal control over the way people think and act and I that makes me sad to say but I think if you totally removed it there would be absolute Anarchy I think it should be replaced with God I think we should have a different system I think people do need controlling MH but if everyone could say what they thought all of the time would the world be a better place I'm not sure but it' be it would certainly be a lot less deceptive and I feel like God's the the truth of God is is is light on issues I think that if we're going to be making decisions which can affect millions of lives or people are going to be blown apart or someone's going to be sent to a war we should at least know the truth about why it's happening and the problem is right now we're operating in such a cloud of deception all of the time and if people could speak their their mind all of the time perhaps we'd remove some of that fog and be a far more open discourse but I don't know if that would lead to absolutely chaos and not it's a very interesting thought experiment I'm not sure yeah and to to speak to that point it's interesting you say that because you look at president Donald Trump right the second on social media it's too loud banned yeah right mate what are your thoughts on the upcoming election President Donald Trump BR you're trying to get me killed I think that it's the last hope for the West I think it's the last hope for the Western Powers as we imagin them and know them I think that America still believes it is the world's only superpower and it's actually two decades behind in its thinking I think they're still holding on to ideas from the '90s and 80s I don't think they're as powerful as they believe they are I think there's other massive Global players I think the decline of Western Society culturally is being accelerated and I believe Trump can slow that down I don't think he can stop it I don't think Trump having four years of presidency are going to prevent the cultural decimation of the West however I certainly think it'll slow it down and we can talk about things politically we can talk about the politics of it and how the election's coming up and whether he's going to win and if they're going to let him win but I think actually truthfully it's culture that drives societies because you could take all of the laws and all of the politicians M of Sweden and put them in power in Burkina Faso and you would not have Sweden MH there's different cultures different ways of life different societies different demographic different everything MH so I think it's culture that drives and you can look at that in a lot of different ways I mean I think firearm statistics prove it probably the best that in Switzerland there there's huge gun ownership and there's no Max shootings and there's no murders but in America there is is that because of the gun laws is that because of the gun prevalence no no it's because of the culture the people and the people so I think Trump would be a massive culture win have you talked to him or his team or any kind of anything or is I I have to be careful what I say publicly because I don't want to get him tied to my current legal mess but that also answers the question sure but um I think it's a cultural win more than it is a political win it's culture that drives because because Trump winning would be fantastic for the culture because it was re it would reestablish masculinity and nationalism and and an air of competence and speaking what you think and removing this fear of political correctness that's a culture win which will have massive ramifications for the culture of the country which is more important than the politics of the country anyway so yeah I think Trump is the last chance because we have to change the culture of the West if we're going to survive the current trajectory of Western culture only ends in being conquered because it doesn't allow men to even be men anymore in nearly any regard and it's only masculine Essence that's going to protect and Preserve Society it's always been that way MH it would be the men that stopped the other people from taking over your village Town Country whatever it was and now that we've removed masculinity absolutely from the West we're going to be conquered and in the short term we're going to be conquered by our women before we're conquered by everyone else and I feel like we're almost already there I'd argue that we live in a society where women have more power than men in nearly every regard I can't think of an example where outside of physical violence where a man has an advantage over a woman in anything anymore and all of a man's natural imperatives are ignored and everything a man cares about is ignored and his feelings are ignored and his desires are ignored and Society still expects certain things of us they still they still expect us to charge into a burning building when it's on fire because only men are going to be able to do that but at the same time they don't want to raise men who are brave and we're in this weird hypocritical scenario which is allowing Society to limp Pawn but in two generations from now there's going to be no men which charge into burning buildings anymore and then what's going to happen may I ask your thoughts on President Biden you're certainly trying to get me killed we don't we don't have to talk about it if you don't want to I'll answer it but but I'll say right here on this podcast that I was thrown in a jail in Romania with heavy support if not instigation from the state department of the United States of America the Democrats okay and uh Biden is a Democrat president and I hope he enjoys hopefully I hope I hope his retirement is coming up soon let's put it that way I think that'd be good for the world you know it's kind of interesting because when you're a tough guy you rely on your bravado and your reputation far more often than your actual capability it doesn't matter we can take it away from countries if you're a gangster right you rely on your name far more often than your actual capability you may build your name off the back of killing two or three people or doing a few heinous things but that name allows you to survive for years without having to do bad things again so it it it's often bark over bite in life and America was the number one example of that and now that they've lost the world's respect they find themselves having to bite and start all these wars and fight all these fights to try and prove they're still the people they said they were and then imagine that's not going as well as it should be it's just accelerating the decline of the respect of the the nation MH and whether that can even be Reed saved anymore and recovered anymore I'm not sure but certainly a weak American president has accelerated the de the decimation of Western Global dominance that's it's that's clear because the America of old could simply bark and that's what made them who they were now Switching gears it's interesting because you know a lot of people hear a lot of what you talk about and they hear a lot of these views on many things in life what do you think is the biggest misconception or thing that been taken out of context of your views cuz a lot of people take Clips stitch them up stuff from eight years ago you know years ago three years ago what do you think is the biggest misconception I don't know if there is a true misconception I think a lot of it's just weaponized virtue I think people sit and pretend that they believe I'm something I'm not because it allows them to attack me and they want to attack me because they don't like me for whatever reason and they can't say I'm not successful and they can't say I'm not happy and I'm not living a good life and they can't say I'm not competent and they can't say I'm stupid so they'll sit there and say I'm a bad person and then why is he a bad person well because of X and they weaponize of virtue pretending they care about whatever issue when they don't I get called a misogynist all the time which I think most people understand isn't true me talking about the natural biological imperatives of men and women does not make me a misogynist me saying that women are better at certain things than men and men are better at certain things than women does not make me a misogynist it makes me a realist mhm but I don't even subscribe to these paradigms anymore I used to sit and explain why I'm not misogynistic but now I refuse to even do that M I am a realist and as a realist I will say some things which can be labeled homophobic sometimes like the fact that the family between a man and a woman and procreation is the future of a nation and the future of society in the future of humanity that will be called homophobic sometimes I will say things that will be called misogynistic sometimes if I say that women are incapable of fighting a man physically you can call me a misogynist for that and you can come along and name about and talk about female UFC fighters and try and pretend the exceptions disprove the rule and you can go down all these stupid arguments which I refuse to do I no longer subscribe to any of these views I am a realist and as a realist if you understand how the world really works you're going to say things sometimes they can take and weaponize and attack you with but then we go back to what we said earlier are you going to be the kind of person who now is afraid to say certain things CU he has to protect his livelihood or he can't take the pressure and take the heat because if you are you're rejecting reality you're effectively living in a false reality because you know the the reality of the real world but you're afraid to say it m so then you're going to pretend reality is different than it is yeah I would argue this I would love for somebody to do this because there was a time people were walking around on YouTube asking people questions in public go up walk through a a feminist City somewhere liberal some liberal City and just ask men and women in general do you think men are stronger than women the most basic simple question and this is not insulting women in any way women love a man who's stronger than them that's what they want it's what they look for so this is not insulting to women but just walk around and ask them and watch how hard they try to cope their way out of telling the truth well it depends on the woman it depends on a man well sometimes what do you mean strong what does strong mean well I know a girl who's a tawo black belt garbage you'll watch them cope their way out of reality because they're scared to say the truth because that truth they feel has consequences so now they are changing the fabric of reality and unfortunately enough of these idiots do that it has massive knock on consequences I would love for someone to walk through Moscow and ask the same question and see how many people would be trying to cope their way out of an answer so we've built a society which is so fearful that people are afraid to tell the basic biological realities of humanity in America where I thought you had the first amendment I thought you had free speech there but in the country where they put free speech in the Constitution people won't say things which are pertinently obvious so it's it's very interesting the level of scop we're currently operating under and how they've tied it all together and how dangerous it can all be so I no longer subscribe to any of these ideals you've asked what do people think of me that isn't true I'm not going to sit and say I'm not a misogynist or I'm not homophobic or I'm not racist or whatever this gar garage to come at me with I don't even care anymore I'm a realist and if you're going to listen to everything I say you'll probably understand that I know that the world is new want and nothing is black and white but if you're going to take a small clip of it you're going to make me whatever you want me to be exactly and you can do that and I can take the I can take the pressure I can take the heat I don't care if they hate me it it doesn't bother me at all because the real world consequences of being disliked I've suffered and I'm still currently suffering at the maximum level mhm being disliked to the point they throw you in jail take all your money away ostracized by the mainstream media attempting to get you effectively assassinated by riing up Psychopaths trying to drag in your family and get them damaged and get them canceled and get their lives ruined I'm at maximum pain threshold if the volume's at the top I don't have to fear them turning it up so I may as well sit and tell the truth now right the the worst they can do to me is throw me back in jail and once again that's fine yeah and and it's interesting because you're absolutely right about it's all about context and nuances and a lot of people play semantics games they'll take a piece of what you say turn it into a narrative but if you think about it just to kind of like zoom out and get philosophical words are social constructs right so one word it's a social construct from society to society so it's easy to group all of the nuances of what you say into misogynist you know and instantly a lot of wisdom gets thrown under that well the people say misogynist don't even know what it means M the people who say misogynist don't even know what misogynistic means most of the time probably can't even spell it of course so they're just matrix-m minded I find it so interesting when I was first arrested and they said andrate human trafficker BBC blah blah blah I find it so interesting that there are people out there which will so instantly adopt a worldview and attach emotional emotional reaction an emotional investment to that worldview with no proof what ever or digging in to understand it absolutely so I was I was arrested and everyone said Andrew a human trafficker BBC Andre T arrested human trafficking Etc within two minutes there are people on Instagram don't know who these people are saying he's a human trafficker he's a terrible person I haven't been convicted they've not seen a picture or a video or heard a witness statement because the victims don't exist they've seen nothing but a headline they are now prepared to die on that Hill they're sitting there arguing it emotionally like they truly believe it in their heart keyboard Warriors how why do you even believe it why do you firstly why do you even care secondly why do you even believe it you've seen no evidence you've seen nothing you've just seen a headline these people you could print the sky is green and they'd sit there and start arguing about it you could say something as stupid let me think of something as stupid as possible men can get pregnant you could start saying that garbage and there are people who would begin to repeat it because they are told it and they'll have an emotional investment in this worldview despite the fact that it's absolute garbage and everybody knows it's not true MH isn't that scary because that's how the worst things on life in in the worst things that have ever happened in the world happen if you look at an ethnic genocide and Let's ignore the one that's currently ongoing which is very saddening Palestine Israel absolutely because it is a genocide but you could take two random tribes in some random Country and if you can say to your people that tribe they're all evil without showing any proof without giving any true reasoning just because you said it and those people will become emotional about what you've said you can now Inspire your tribe to murder the others that's how bad things happen the the people who pretend to be virtuous the ones who call me misogynistic the ones who sit there and say he's a human trafficker they're the ones who are so easily emotionally manipulated those are the ones who always end up doing the worst things in in history those are the bad people the good people sit and say wait okay the BBC said this but the BBC lie and all they've ever done is lie where is the evidence show me is he convicted where's the court case where's the victims is there anything here yeah people don't even think that critically it's crazy instead of innocent to proving guilty they flipped it on you guilty until proving and it's not even just about me and it's not it's it's just about all the narratives in the world today the fact that they can still after lying to us so many times print something and people will instantly just believe it and start repeating it and emotionally defending it it's the emotionality that fears me if the people who were defending it were saying well the mainstream media said this so perhaps we should investigate it quite logically it wouldn't I wouldn't be so afraid what Fe what makes me scared is that people will become emotionally invested instantly and prepared to defend it with their emotions and they'll be angry if you don't believe it also with zero context zero evidence zero anything because those are the people that do the most heinous things Co was based on people like that the vaccine was based on people like that there were people calling for you to not be able to leave your house for you to be put in prison if you don't get a vaccine curfews curfew there was people calling for you to have your life ruined if you don't get a vaccine and these same people now haven't even introspected and worked out that they were fooled and scoped are now continuing to believe in scops and repeat them these are dangerous people they are agents of the Matrix in and of themselves and they're not sitting there going I'm a bad person I am being fooled I'm a weapon of war against humanity and freedom and everything beautiful about life instead they're sitting there saying I know the PBC is human trafficker it's crazy so that's why I don't prescribe to any of these insults or any of these brackets they try and put me in the parameters of misogyny or the parameters of homophobic I don't prescribe to it because the kind of people who even use those words are just weapon are just people who can be weaponized into false virtues to attack anyone who speaks against the Matrix in the first place and what I love too is that you give a lot of nuance and it's it's really interesting because if people see a one minute clip it's very different than when they hear you elaborate right they hear a microcosm you know for example with the homosexuality thing like I like I love that you said earlier like I don't have a problem with that I'm cool with it on the microcosm you know that's one thing but your philosophy is more about at scale Society what it does your opinions on that but they take it well how are you attacking me for it right so it's a it's the frame control that people have I'm curious what do you say to people cuz I've heard this so many times uh about you is that a lot of people agree with a lot of your philosophies right on a global scale but they say you know the thing about Tate is that his style is a little aggressive and it that's the issue I have and I think what he's saying is good but I think the level of intensity or the animation or the passion he communicates with is intense and I don't like the way he communicates his message what are your thoughts to people who say that they like your message but your delivery is a little intense yeah they they judge the delivery more so than the message the nuances right hey guys quick question have you been enjoying this video but you're thinking to yourself man I love this content but I want to learn how to grow my brand or my business well if your answer is yes you're not alone in fact millions of entrepreneurs deal with this exact same issue and it's something that I've learned the answer to from interviewing seven eight and nine figer entrepreneurs around the world and this philosophy that solves all that is a concept called who not how now the who not how Phil philosophy states that anytime you're stuck on the house to get to the next level in your life your brand or your business that there's always a who to help you get there and it's for this exact reason that I'm super excited to announce that I've officially launched our brand new passionate few Community to help you do exactly that and yes it's 100% free join me and the thousands of other entrepreneurs that can help you make your life your business and your dreams a reality with no further Ado let's get back to the video it's very interesting to me that we've also reached a stage of society where men being animated or passionate is somehow seen as offensive the passionate few yeah but so let's analyze what you just said I'm person X I like what Andrew says I believe what he says is true I believe what he says can benefit people he's helped me and I like his worldview and I think he's a good person but he said it loud like but that's that's but that's where reaching now we're reaching such a level of softness in society that people don't like the way I say things because it comes across to aggressive I understand what they're trying to say but what they're truly doing is broadcasting their ineptitude and their and their immaturity if you told me something which was profound and I agree with it I wouldn't really care how you said it so much in fact the delivery vehicle I have opted to use I've chosen because it's the most effective and I believe that men should be as competent as possible meaning if this is the most effective way for me to get my message across this is how it should be done and also I don't see why men need to be meek and timid all the time who told men to be meek and timid all of the time why can't a man sit there and say no I believe this these clowns will stand in a stadium and scream at the top of their voice for a sports team who don't give a [ __ ] about them to kick a ball in a net to kick a ball in a net but they don't think that a man should be animated when discussing the truths of the world or the Dynamics he should have with his wife or how his children should be raised I believe what I say and I'm going to express the emotions I feel as I say it how I see fit and if you are such a stupid person you can't listen to the message without getting offended by how it's said well then perhaps you're already too far gone and you're too broken that's fine you're just going to have to go and stay a dummy and stay an idiot and one of the best things about being at the oper echelons is that I don't really need I guess you do break the Paradigm and you break the the final wall and I kind of feel like I've reached a point now where I don't need people to agree with me I don't care if everybody watches this and doesn't agree with me anymore it doesn't affect my life it doesn't matter I don't need to say things people want to hear to get big I don't need to say things people want to hear to get paid I can just say what I truly believe and what I truly think and I think we need to bring back passion in general I think men should be passionate about what they think feminists are passionate aren't they that's why the show's called the passionate few well absolutely have you ever heard anyone tell a woman off or a feminist off for being too passionate about what she says or how she says it or being too emotional about how she says it it's it's just another I feel like it's a cope I kind of feel like there's a lot of people someone who would say that that I agree with Andrew but I don't like the way he says it I think what they're really trying to do is put a shield over themselves I don't think they're mad enough to sit there and say I agree with Andrew tapate to stand on it yeah to stand on it I agree with Andrew tape because it's smoke I agree with Andrew tape you know the way he says some things and then someone will come back you can't you agree with and Tate well no you know the way he says things is wrong and they're just trying to set up their Escape Route in advance because they're a coward they do that with Trump too A lot of people say that about President Trump I bet they do yeah of course they do so it's just cowardice and I've yet to meet anyone to I've yet to meet anyone who says that to me in person and I'm sure these people do exist and they're going to have to sit in their life and half believe and half commit to things I don't know how you're going to I don't know how you expect as a man to get anywhere in life if you have commit to anything out anyway you have to be the kind of person who constantly and fully endlessly commits with absolute devotion if you you have to be Allin so if you're going to sit there and agree with everything I say or anyone says and then be too afraid to even admit that yeah well then you have a much deeper problem yeah and and to zoom in on it there's something I heard super interesting and that's related to IQ you know like people talk about IQ tests or how they measure intelligence and what's interesting is it said that you know people hear the word intelligence maturity understanding but if you zoom in what's really interesting is that intelligence is measured by an individual's ability to make refined distinctions about a set of data right refined distinctions so for example to to make the point clear you know a cup of water yeah this is a cup of water a more intelligent person would say this is a glass with x amount of water a more intelligent person would say this is a a this type of glass with this amount of water that's this tall that's you know shaped in this particular way and so it's about the nuances and having the mental um ability to understand those refined distinctions and I think Society by and large just wants the quickest label and they don't want those distinctions because those distinctions force them to confront themselves and confront truths that Society doesn't want you to because the more vague you are the more Society can control the frame of what it is oh absolutely and also people don't understand that when you're doing podcasts or you're talking to the internet or you're talking about subjects in general you don't have time to cater for every possible eventuality yeah I sit here and I say men are physically stronger than women and they and often feminists will then come with exceptions to the rule I don't have time to say men are physically stronger than women except for This Woman This Woman This Woman or in this particular tribe or this particular country or this subset of data that you can't even communicate that way yeah you'll spend your whole time being politically correct and Mage the message in the process absolutely and my only goal as I continue is to become more abrasive and more offensive so if anyone's upset with me so far they have a ro root Awakening coming because my only goal especially once I beat this Matrix attack is to be worse than ever before mhm I enjoy it it's fun more passionate yeah because there's also there's ways you can say things which are deliberately abrasive and sometimes depending on who I'm discussing and who I'm arguing with who I'm debating with at the time I might choose to be deliberately abrasive I can say men are physically stronger than women I can say females are weak MH I can say things which are deliberately designed to be abrasive at the time and sometimes I'll do that because I find it entertaining and it doesn't mean you don't love women or respect women or see the value in them I well I find it crazy that there's anyone out there who sits and thinks I wake up and I hate women I would argue that these male feminists these weirdos they hate women more because they're the ones who are constantly rejected by women like why would I hate women I've had no negative interactions with women my life doesn't have any current negative interactions with women I have a happy relationship with women I have children with women I have happy like I don't understand this worldview where you're going to wake up and say Andrew hates women why because I said that men are physically stronger and we should protect them because I think that men are better at certain things and women are better at certain things I don't even think they truly believe it they either say it deliberately because it's weaponized virtue or they're just repeating what they heard and a lot of people just repeat what they heard as we discussed earlier they don't have any true basis for any of these things there are rappers who sing about [ __ ] and hoes no one says they hate women yeah people sing along to theong songs yeah in the club yeah exactly no problem it's funny I even it's funny you see that in Western Society obviously throughout the years it's gone progressively worse but the same woman that'll argue oh my God and not want to hear the philosophies and nuances has no problem singing along to the song about you know for example the weekend cheating on you know cheating on multiple and they sing along and they dance to it and they love it but the second it's communicated with Nuance intellectualism it's like whoa whoa whoa whoa hey you got to draw the line somewhere don't you think it's scary that there's so many people going through life who literally don't think yeah limited depth yeah they don't think about anything yeah surface level they don't go deep they go wide not deep and these are the people who are weaponized Against Humanity as a whole you talk about the Matrix movie and they say anyone who's not unplugged can become an agent at any time that's absolutely true there are people who are not unplugged from The Matrix who can morph into an agent in real time you'll watch them do it just like in the movie where they change and they become an agent if you mention certain subjects to certain people you'll see their whole face instantly change and they start repeating CNN mhm they become an agent for the Matrix and it's like they I don't know if it's a fear mechanism where they're just afraid to hold a view which is counter to The Narrative of the society they live under or if it's trained into them from a very young age through brutal Conformity of the mediocracy of their parents I'm not sure what it is but it's kind of scary that there's so many people out here in the world who literally just do not think MH I try very hard now that I'm successful to avoid these people and I do pretty good job of never interacting with them ever outside of the internet but I don't know I've tried to imagine myself living a life like them like what is the what is what is the life now if you wake up and you're a man and you do what you're supposed to do you do what you're told to do what is your life you wake up you go to school you go to college you get in debt you go to university you get in debt you get a job mhm you find a woman she is of course equal to you in every way so she's some py of feminist yeah but at the same time you got to open the door for them be a gentleman take care of them but we're equal well well yeah you're supposed to right but I don't know if you'd even have the Constitution to do those things you're probably going 5050 on the bills which means she doesn't respect you properly anyway not truthfully because you're not a provider to her she you ever gone 50/50 on a bill with a woman absolutely never I never would no yeah I'm I'm just imagining the man 's life who's living the way he's supposed to live and it just sounds dire it sounds desperate and miserable MH you're in debt you have a wife who maybe you can convince to have one kid and then eventually you're going to end up divorced and you're going to be sad and lonely and miserable and of course it's all your fault because you didn't respect her feelings enough you did something wrong at some point and you're working away at your slave job and perhaps you'll be able to retire when you're 77 and it just sounds like destitution MH so if the path that the Matrix has laid out for the average man is so brutally terrifying I'm not sure why anybody is adopting any of the thinking that the Matrix wants them to have you can see as a man what the Matrix wants you to become and the life they want you to live so you should have enough brain to sit and say well I don't want any of that so if I don't want any of it why do I even want to adopt part of it or half of it why do you want to adopt any of their thinking if it's all just based towards reducing your masculine imperatives to the point where you'll accept that man won't accept a sexless marriage where his woman doesn't respect him a man won't accept being in debt his whole life and not having Financial Freedom a man won't accept being mocked and not respected or not being allowed to say his opinion in the workplace because he'll get fired a man won't accept these things so the only way they get you to accept these things is to destroy your Baseline masculinity in the first place because then you're not a man anymore you're a neutered version of a man and you'll sit there and you'll accept this subpar reality which is why they're attacking masculinity so heavily so they can get you to adopt and agree with this garbage life they've laid out for you all of it is terrifying I find it remarkable that anybody believes any of this and one of the things I love about you man is like you have the balls to say what a lot of people think like I can't tell you how many people in positions of power agree with you but because of the Matrix because of getting paid because of the people they they got to stay quiet and they Champion you kind of behind the scenes but then you get all the you know you get all the heat smoke for being the guy literally you got all the smoke yeah but it's something that I've seen reoccurring in your life from you know the chess early on to fighting right how did kickboxing how did that affect your persona like what impact did that have on you obviously the career a little bit but obviously fighting there's a parallel to life what influenced the kickboxing play in your life yeah absolutely I think it's the rawest and most pure form of competition it's always been the only competition throughout Humanity for a very long time mono imano of course I mean you can put a ball in a net if you want I mean I it just feels so asinine to become extremely good at putting a ball in that I don't want to insult footballers they make a lot of money and they're talented and they train hard I have respect for all of them but it just feels like if you get to wake up one day and says Andrew okay you have to become an athlete do you want to be able to destroy men with your bare hands for the rest of your human life and as you walk through Earth know that you're a weapon of war or put a ball in a net just it just feels pretty easy choice to me yeah it's it's to and before these Sports which are just water down versions of War there was simply fighting so I fought because I think that all men want to fight I can't imagine waking up being a man and not wanting to fight M for something meaningful just you want to fight I I I'm sure there's men who don't feel this way but when I wake up in the morning I have my 15 coffees and I want to fight that's what I want to do and whether that's fiscally make as much money as possible whether that's combat The Matrix send their narratives or what that was going in the ring and beating the [ __ ] out somebody I wanted to fight back then I had no money I had no influence it was almost before the internet 15 16 years ago there's nothing else I could do constructive with my masculine energy besides fight so then you have to choose do I fight for a government which doesn't care about me or do I fight for myself and try and pay my bills and I decide to fight for myself I think that that Warrior urge is inside of every single man well it must be because if you look at history that's all we've ever done is fight all we ever did was get in large gangs and large groups call them armies call them whatever you want nation states and we just go to go to war and I think in the modern society now most men dedicate that energy towards making money which they should do if they're healthy towards Conquest but I just wanted to fight and I couldn't think of another way to do it what we're doing right now is a fight you trying to get as many views as possible and get your YouTube channel as large as possible that is war against all the other YouTube channels you should just turn up and punch them in the face get it on but that's but that's the human instinct so I fought because I couldn't find a better outlet and then I retired because I found another Outlet how old were you when you retired 303 and then I fought a couple times since when I was like 33 I took a fights on one day's notice to touch base real quick on kickboxing too I do want to ask what did it teach you in terms of the ability to like conquer your own mind right cuz I'm sure there was times early on as you were growing where you could be intimidated by something of course you're Andrew Tate so barely intimidated well but it teaches you to fight against the resistance right like what also and the reason I ask is because you know I've talked to a lot of high level people and you'll find early on that there's a lot of fighting background or wrestling he teaches you how to get out of a pinch that there's always a maneuver out of something that feels impossible to get out of so I'm curious for you like what are some parallels like that that kickboxing taught you on a tactical level for life I think that a lot of people who are afraid to do something like professional fighting imagine that the fighters Are Not Afraid which is not true mhm true bravery is to be afraid and do it anyway if you're not afraid you're not being brave it's easy to do something you're not afraid of doing well then you're not a brave person in the first place if there's something wrong with you in your head and you're Psychopathic and you can get in the Octagon for essentially a fight to the death with a man who has dedicated his life to being good at fighting to the death and you have no nerves whatsoever then there's something wrong with you and you're not brave you're an idiot yeah Fighters are afraid but we do it anyway mhm and I think that's a good mantra for life to be afraid but do it anyway that's the whole point of life that's how you're going to get most things done whether it's business or anything else and you become very good with nerves and you become very good with a poker face and you become very good at doing the things you need to do regardless of how you feel at the time you may feel intimidated or you may feel nervous or you may have a bad day you may have a cold you may be tired who knows but you have to fight on that day at that time it's showtime so it has to be done right and I think it's a good mantra for Life over overall and it especially when they threw Tristan and I in jail for example which we can talk about later on but when they throw when they throw you in jail obviously you're about to walk into a Romanian dungeon You're not sure what it's like and Tristan and I looked at each other and kind of smiled because we knew it's like walking into the octagon it's the same thing you don't know where you're going to be you don't know what the other guys in there are going to be like you just have to Poker Face it and and act the way you're supposed to act regardless of how you feel and I think that's that's the true masculine imperative anyways and it aren't Men supposed to go through life doing what they're supposed to do because it needs to be done as opposed to doing what they feel like doing mhm and I think one of the biggest problems with the world today is that men keep talking about how they feel there's not a single man around me who says I feel like I live with guys and we have this big house and we're all having fun all the time and I'm trying to think of a man around me who says I feel because nobody cares why would I care how you feel why would life care how you feel Society doesn't care how men feel so if nobody cares how men feel why do they care how they feel you wake up and you have a list of things that need to be done you're either going to do them or you're going to make excuses and how you feel has no bearing on that list the list must be completed IR regardless of how you feel so why are we even putting importance on those feelings I think you learn to ignore feelings early on you learn to ignore pain and many other things and I think that's the best way a man should be I think that's how you become brutally competent and competitive and you live your life by your values not your feelings per se Yeah well yeah absolutely and your values are going to come with duties and tasks right if you have values what whatever they are then you're going to have to sustain those values MH it's you can't sit well some people do I said you can't but some people do exactly this they say I value X but they won't work to support X or they won't work to prove ex if you don't work for something or you're not prepared to suffer or struggle for something then you don't love it and you don't believe in it anyway if you love a woman you'll struggle to keep her right if you love a country you'll struggle to defend it if you love a a sport or business or a business you're going to work for it if you're not working for it then you don't love it anyway so the values come with obligations and those obligations are to fulfill your duty irregardless of how you feel MH and there's a lot of men out there especially in the world today who only want to do things because they feel a certain way not understanding that that doesn't make them competitive anymore the biggest question I get asked all the time is hey I lack motivation and it's an annoying question to me because so do I sometimes I don't always feel motivated to go to the gym I don't always feel motivated to work I don't always feel motivated to do what I need to do but I do it anyway it's called discipline yeah and if you're going to wake up every day and lack the motivation to do what should be done and compete against people who will do it irregardless of how they feel you're going to perpetually and forever lose in fact it makes you a child to even wake up and say when you're asking someone for motivation what you're effectively doing is saying make me want to do it please make me want to do it I don't want to do it mhm make me want to no you have to do it or you can stay a [ __ ] loser what do you do on a day-to-day to cultivate the confidence because I think one of the things that hundreds of millions of people billions probably at this stage respect about you is that there's no denying people can love you hate you have opinions but nobody denies you're a confident [ __ ] yeah so so is that something that is like just identity based or is that something you cultivate are there anything things dayto day you do to to strengthen it I know what I'm good at and I make sure I focus on it and you delegate the rest or outs and I delegate the rest or Source the rest I I know exactly what I'm good at doing and I think that you're going to be confident if you do things you're good at doing most of the time and have the self- awareness to to accept that yeah and also I'm not afraid of anything I want to make this clear I'm I'm sure when they finally point a gun to my head I'm going to be a bit nervous but all in all I I it is what it is and we all live one life and I think the best thing you can do as a man is try to make your mark on the world and make people understand how and why you think and try and be a positive influence and have children and I've done all of those things mhm what's what are they going to do throw me in jail mhm I mean I'm confident because I just don't fear any of these idiots anymore when the BBC turn up and they try to intimidate me because that's what they try to do I saw that interview they they framed a question and right away you nailed them not accepting the frame of course they're clowns and when they try to intimidate me and they come with their agendas and they expect me to be scared of these people I don't fear these people at all because I don't respect these people so I guess confidence just comes from the fact that I know at the end of the day I'm going to be okay and I have a lot of faith in myself and I also have a lot of faith in future Andrew I feel like if I'm pretty good now I'll be better in the future so as the Matrix attacks increase or as my enemies get more inventive or more creative or whatever comes my way I'm sure at the age of 50 I'll be more capable of dealing with it than I am today so yeah it is what it is and I also enjoy the struggles of life I enjoy the War I I like when it's it's incorrect for me to say I like when bad things happen that's the that's the wrong way to look at it but there's certainly a part of me that gets excited mhm maybe that's the warrior in me but when they say even when I think back now I'll be completely honest with you if I could if I could go back retrospectively and avoid going to jail I wouldn't have done it if I could have stopped it I wouldn't have stopped it because now I think about it it was exciting and you you were living out of your values well yeah it's it's it's it's War it's exciting like bad things can happen it's a terrible experience you're going to suffer I enjoy all of those things MH retrospectively I don't maybe some men are different but I think if if you ask the average man to think back on the times in of his life that he really suffered or he hated you usually if there a good man retrospectively they're glad they happened at the time you may hate them but not very many men are going to sit and say oh I wish I didn't have to go through that maybe the love the loss of a loved one or something sure but in general I think I think they're the best things ever happened to people mhm that's when you grow the most you have conversations with God you're introspective you grow the most absolutely and and those are your stories yeah if if you sit a man down and say tell tell us a story and what's he GNA say oh I went to the club and I got balles and I got a girl is that your story I mean maybe it is for some guys but I think the coolest stories are going to be the War Stories how you conquered War absolutely so how you beat the Matrix well bad things are supposed to happen to us and my confidence comes from the fact that I'm not afraid of any of these things because I know they're supposed to happen and I know that there're a massive opportunity and I feel excited by them what are some of the things that people would be shocked to know maybe you deal with not on an insecurity level because I'm you know I would ask you know what are some insecurities you have but what are some things that's a good question what are some insec now let me steal it from you what are some insecurities I let me see if I can even think of any and everyone's going to call no but people going to call me disingenuine but I'm not being disingenuine because I'll give you an example I had a guy messaged me and he said Andrew I don't know what to do I'm uh 5 foot one I'm really short I'm I'm training and I've got lots of money and I'm really short and I don't know what to do I was like bro do exactly what you do if you were tall I mean maybe not play basketball but be confident and be your best self and train as hard as possible and be a good person and make money and be dedicated and be diligent why would anything change MH you are who you are and you play the hand you have just like in poker you can't help if you have pocket aces or something else you play the hand and that's how you win the game you can you you you can win a game with a with nothing you can Bluff your way through it so when I say I don't have insecurities it's not because I can't think of anything about myself that isn't perfect it's just because I don't care it doesn't matter this is who I am this is the life I'm going to live I'm going to do my absolute best irregardless of what I have heaven forbid something bad happens to me I'm in a car crash and I lose my arm well I'll still get up and just train and work and see my children and I'll do exactly the same thing I'm doing now what could you do so I think insecurities are a waste of time I think it's a waste of cognition to even sit and consider an insecurity I am who I am MH so I don't know I can't think of any insecurities I can't were you ever insecure with the ladies coming up well you're nervous I guess Andrew Tate used to get nervous as women well when you're a teenager when you're a teenager I think everyone is but I also think the dating Market was different back then because you actually had to go up to girls and talk to them and they weren't Instagram famous with guys that'll flly out to Dubai the second they turn 18 19 that's right yeah the whole world was a completely different place you'd have to go up to girls and say hello for the first thing which most modern men probably don't do anymore CU it's all online or Instagram Etc so that was a huge part of it and secondly I guess the counter to that is that women were a bit more humble because they weren't getting floa around the world from their Instagram profil so there was a interesting dating Market which is completely gone now most men now I don't think cold approach women very often maybe they do I don't know and you talk about something beautiful I was listening to an interview interview you did recently and you talk about how you know now there's a stigma if men go up to a women and say they're beautiful or talk to him like oh he's cringe he's a creeper but you made a great point cuz you said everybody in this room right now is here because a man approached a woman and they had sex AB some of the greatest things in the world were created as a byproduct of that but yet now we stigmatize it like you're weird well it's it's an attack on masculinity along with everything else but now is some form of sexual assault or some form of perversion did you ever see that video I think it was five or six years ago it was a woman walking through New York City and she recorded herself for eight hours walking around in circles like a dummy and then dudes would say hey you're good-looking and she'd pretend she was offended and then she got her editing crew together and sat there with her cat and cuz she has no girl boyfriend and edited all the video together and took that eight hours of footage and condensed it down to three minutes of being asked if she's okay and pretended how she's victimized yeah and the world jumps on the bandwagon in comments and my God said hello but that's exactly the reason we're all here right now A man at some Point went up to a woman and said hello and if you ask a woman she wants to be quartered and chased women love being chased anyway of course like all things this is nuanced I'm not saying to be a stalker I'm not going be a creep obviously there's some dudes who are weird Etc but not too long ago yes a man had to go up to a woman and say hello and that's changed now it's moved all to this digital realm and then in the digital realm we're just measuring People based on social media profiles which is obviously a highlight of their life MH and then women are becoming more and more duded in their expectations because they're looking at the these men who have these certain Lifestyles and certain capabilities and they believe they deserve them and they're also going to attach to that the insanity and of of monogamy to that I find that really interesting that a woman will sit there and go you know I'm simple I just want a man who's rich and tall and strong and smart and charismatic and interesting and spontaneous and loves my cat and cares about my feelings and likes to talk and likes to say movies as me and wants to hang out with my family and he has a Lamborghini and he has lots of money and we go onid holay and he has a big house and he's really musly that's all I want and he only wants me he doesn't want any other girl just me it's clown world and then they and then you have the average man who would even offer them some degree of normality they'll ignore because they want this guy MH thinking that in their hubris because women can be self-d deluded sometimes that they're I don't know the only pretty girl who wants this guy mhm and and they all and they end up sharing him and then they have a mental breakdown over it and they either stay or they or they they run and try and find another dude and hypergamy yeah and it goes over and over and over again so that's that's the modern dating Market which is extremely difficult I'd estimate for most men to navigate what do you think are the consequences of that scaled out over the next 10 20 30 years and Beyond because the world is going that way it's kind of interesting we're going back to the way you know they say history repeats and the world is cyclical aren't we going back to how it used to be didn't Kings have like 10 wives mhm and the average man was just dying in a war somewhere suffering survival of the fittest yeah I mean it's kind of getting there now I'm sure you if you're I wouldn't know but if you were a world-renowned billionaire uh you'd have as many as many as much option you'd have as many options as you liked yeah so I think it's always been that way Kings have always had more than one and and we I don't do many dating podcasts anymore but the odd Clips I see you see the odd idiot women or there's some guys were sitting there saying high value men don't cheat and there's always women saying no real men don't cheat listen it's the women who were deciding to share these famous men it's the women who are deciding to chase famous men who have unlimited options it's the women deciding to chase a man with resource you are making the choices and then you're surprised that you're ending up in the situation you're in it's this is human nature and you talk about something really interesting I was listening to the uh George jenko podcast and you were talking about you know you talked about the concept of polygamy right and we have multiple you know women or partners and you were saying that you know Society stigmatizes it and it's shocking to people to hear this but if you open your mind and kind of hear the rationale I think it's really interesting because you talk about well you know people criticize that but then the same guy who's loyal behind the scenes is you know masturbating or watching porn or going to strip clubs or whatever it is course the masc the masculine imperative is to conquer like we said earlier it's our imperative to make as much money as possible and be as big and strong as possible and be as important as possible and to conquer land to go and take something from someone else and by extension the masculine imperative is to conquer that can also be applied to sexuality we we're interested in Conquest so if a man has the capability to sleep with lots of women he probably will sleep with lots of women MH and this idea that men are loyal or that women are obsessed with this idea of having a man which is loyal is actually quite interesting because I think it's one of the main reasons women end up so heartbroken and so bitter in the first place and the divorce rates are so high women mostly initiate that of course but women what they do is they get with a guy he's a good guy they love him he's their best friend he takes care of them they're happy The Man Cheats they get heartbroken they leave the guy they get with another guy who they love less than the first guy who wasn't even as good as he was he cheats they leave him they get with another guy and after seven or eight or 10 or 12 or however many it takes for their heart to finally die then they end up just on the Carousel of hom doing only fans and it's not because they intended on being that type of person it's not because they wanted to be promiscuous it's because of their obsession with loyalty that they end up just running from place to place the truth is and I say these things and I know there's a lot of people who counter my view but most of them are not important enough for me to talk to so I don't care but the truth is men have an innate desire to conquer masculine sexuality is very different than female sexuality men act in a certain way because we don't feel the consequences of those actions like a woman does EG pregnancy MH and this obsession with loyalty is so asinine because it's not even real to go into the point you made earlier women say oh but my man's loyal well there's two points to that the first thing is if he has no other option he's not really loyal if you go into a grocery store and they only sell apples and you buy an Apple every day you're not allowed to tell me you love Apples because you don't have any other choice it's when you go into a grocery store and they have a whole wide array of fruit and you buy an Apple six days a week but on Wednesdays you take a banana or grape then you're allowed to say I love Apples because you have options and you still choose the Apple the majority of the time a lot of women say my man's loyal I say listen if he could [ __ ] he would no girl wants him congratulations that's the first thing the second thing is this whole idea of loyalty once again is skewed because all these men who are in faithful monogamous relationships are talking to webcam girls or buying only fans or masturbating to porn or trying to [ __ ] girls who won't [ __ ] them chasing girls on Instagram who ignore them anyway is that loyalty that's just failure that's not loyalty that's just failing to succeed why are you going to be with a failure what kind of woman wants to be with a failure my woman needs to believe in me if I say to her I'm going to get that chick I better get her MH if I was a chick and my dude said I tried to cheat on you but she rejected me I'd be more off put than if he cheated I'm like you couldn't even get the [ __ ] what am I with you for then crazy so the whole thing is messed up because it's not natural human nature and I think that the it's interesting because you can apply it to so many things and I understand how the nuclear family and monogamy and Society can function under that Paradigm well I understand why it's being promoted or why it was promoted for so long for the stability of a society I understand all of these things very well I'm just commentating I'm just making social commentary but for the longest period of human time it was kings men of resource and capability and status with multiple partners this is how it was and then most men couldn't find a partner at all and I feel like we're returning to that point MH and people often ask me what we should do about that and I don't know what they want me to do I'm I'm just making the point of where we're ending up and women are driving this women are driving this through their choices and through their obsession with with with resource and finance and status and choosing these men and it's also very interesting because they don't expect any of these men to ever truly be loyal at the beginning it's only after they get their claws into him that they start having a mental breakdown if he gets another girlfriend because they're jealous but if they look at him from the start they know what they're going to get and they still choose it so that's where we are it's very interesting and it's funny because a lot of people had these opinions but before you came into the world like out of nowhere and became the biggest thing media men cheat sometimes men cheat if your man pays your bills and he loves you and he die to protect you and he takes care of you and he's fixed all your problems and he forgave you that time you crashed the car like an idiot and and he cheated just stay with him get over it get over it that's that's the way Humanity's always been it's there's so many scops we're operating under where we're going to come along and pretend Humanity hasn't always been the same way all of the time that's the way it's always operated between men and women to a degree do you think that's the most controversial point that you have obviously you have many but is that the one you get most of the heat for or what do you think is the biggest uh opinion you have that gives you a lot of heat you know it's interesting because I probably should know the answer to this question but I don't listen to any of the opinions anyone has of me very often I see clips that go viral I've seen some guys sit and say hi status men don't cheat and I look at him I said bro your arms are skinny shut up bro now okay question I have for you and we didn't touch on base on this but when you were young was it a big dream to be Rich As [ __ ] yes because money is freedom and anybody who says they don't care about being rich is saying they don't care about being free what what was the dream for you though Freedom money is freedom I anyone who says I I don't care about money I don't care about fancy things it's not about fancy things it's the ability to go where you want and sleep where you want and say what you want and think what you want and talk to who you want and even get the girl you want and drive the car you want and eat the food you want to sit and say I don't care about money is to say I don't care about my own personal freedom I have no problems being a slave and being constrained by the financial system and being told what to do because I don't have any desire to be free what books did you read to cultivate that that desire early on when you decided you want to get rich or I just understood that there was a version of reality that I had yet to experience I saw my parents struggle to pay the bills and I saw my friends struggle to pay the bills and I saw everyone around me unable to eat and then I saw certain people with $500,000 cars and I understood there must be a different version of reality there must be a version of making money a version of banking of finance of Education of knowledge of network of connections that existed outside the Matrix there has to be a different world this world I'm in everyone's poor this is garbage that world I can see people are living a reality that I can't even fathom I couldn't even imagine having $500,000 for a car or $500,000 watch or 20 of them but I couldn't imagine it how many watches do you have how many watches do decot have or I have decot took my entire watch collection when they arrested me I had 21 diamond watches and they took them all and my first phone call from jail was to order them all again because it annoyed me that they had all my watches what do you love about watches I just wanted my watches back yeah so I spent another I think it was seven million dollars on bunch more watches from the jail Cale so now if I get my things back from the court I'll have two of every watch which be cool no Noah Arc yeah two of everyone Noah Arc I like that Noah Arc two of everyone Batman Batgirl now what what was your first uh luxury watch do you remember my first luxury watch wasn't even that luxury was a hu hu blow for £1,100 I bought in westfields London and I remember walking past and I had1 15,000 in the bank which to me at the time was a whole bunch of money and I saw it and I remember thinking who can spend 12 Grand on a watch just buy a watch and I thought well technically I could but it's all my savings but technically I could so I did it no you said [ __ ] it did it just [ __ ] it and did it yeah spent my money how old were you 24 something like that and of course everyone around you honey why'd you do that your mom like course don't you spend all your money are you crazy it's only for a watch did it level you up mentally I've never really respected money like that I've never really believed in saving money I don't think you can't save it faster than they can print it I think there's always a better way to blast money into something do you do you do anything to at least early on did you do anything to stay Money Motivated I know there's a lot of people who talked about you know when they have reserves of cash to spend it reinvest in themselves to level up not saying you did that per se but was that a part of it like stretching yourself to level up kind of thing I I know what you're saying I yes is the answer but I don't think it was thought of in that way I literally just didn't respect money I just thought if I'm smart enough to make this money now future Andrew will be smart enough to make more later so it's going to be fine I think that saving money is a scarcity mindset and it's to a degree it's fear I need to keep my money because in the future I might need it it's just being a it's just being a [ __ ] yeah like if I need money in the future I'll go make it so I'm GNA spend it all now and if I need money I'll go make some money and if I don't know how to make money even better because then I'll think of a new way to make money I just never approached it from that fearful angle and I literally looked at the watch and thought who can spend 12 Grand on just a watch and then I realized I technically could but shouldn't so I did it and I was happy for like a full 45 minutes and then I thought well this is kind of I mean maybe I shouldn't have done this what what what other watches uh in the collection did you have after that oh I have I have everything you can name now I have a bunch of PEX a bunch I don't like RMS but this is another thing that's weird you know what's really weird about being famous you have to be super careful what you say yeah it's weird like I can sit here and name all the watches I have in like right right what I will do is boost the price of those watches and those watches will begin to sell and I'm not getting paid off of that and then I'll say a brand I don't like and then I'll meet the owner of that brand and he'll be in a bad mood with me and I'll be like sorry bro I didn't mean to damage your business I just don't particularly like those watches so you end up sitting here thinking you have to be careful what you say you have 59 cars what's your favorite car I was like I meet the CEOs of these car companies I can't sit and say which car is crap and which car is good I mean I could they're all good at different things okay I have 59 cars and people ask me what do I need 59 cars for and I try and explain it's like having 59 different types of Cutlery you know you can have a fork a spoon a knife and whatever other kinds it depends what you're eating right sometimes the spoon is the best sometimes the fork is the best sometimes the knife is the best it depends what you're eating but my favorite car is 812 Ferrari I think that is my favorite car and I I love I love Ferrari I got I got to handshake you 812 Ferrari I think that might be the best car yeah and I think it's the best car overall because it does so many things amazingly but if I had to race myself around a track then it would be a 765 McLaren that that is the fastest car but it's not the best car people think fastest is the best that's not the case so what are the top five what would you name them give or take I would I would say 765 812 and then I'd probably choose three Aston Martins because I just love Aston Martins James Bond yeah that's me that's the James Bond in you huh that's right yeah I like the sf9 E Ferrari as well to be fair to it yeah the s sf9 s yeah but I love all my cars I can't choose it's like trying to choose between my wives you can't make me do that on camera I don't know they're all good at different things what do you want dessert do you want dinner like you want massage you know it's different things what was your first superar my first superar was an ASM Martin Vantage really and I spent all of my money when I say all of my money I didn't have gas all of my money on an ason Martin I thought I don't need a nice place to live I have an ason Martin I'll I'll get girls anyway I don't need gas I just borrow gas money I was borrowing gas money off my girlfriend no way yeah who worked a normal job in a spa for my Aston Martin Vantage at like 23 24 around similar just just after the watch incident I made some more money and spent all my money so I had this nice watch this nice car no money at all best days and you feel like the pressure I missed them do you feel like the pressure of that leveled you up I know that wasn't the intention per se but I mean the the the fact cuz I've heard that a lot like I've even heard Trump talk about early on he had friends and business associates who they'd fly first class even if it was a stretch because it became the new standard and then you start operating and making business moves to keep up that standard Absolut versus trying to hang on to what you got and that kind completely it's yeah absolutely you're right you put pressure on yourself and you have bills to pay and you have no money in the bank and it has to be done and hedonistic adaptation is a real thing it's amazing how quickly you can adapt to a new standard of life and no longer appreciate it I give you a very simple example when I first started flying private the first couple times it was like whoa we even got wait in the airport now it's just flying and it's inconvenient it's annoying yeah I I'm on a I'm on a private jet everyone's like wow you're all these girls my I hate flying so you get used to it hetic adaptation is a real thing and it's it's good that you say this because the human mind is not very good at going backwards you can drive a Toyota and be relatively happy but to drive an Aston Martin and then drive a Toyota is a lot more difficult for your soul to accept so it's it's good to put yourself in things like first class and these things and push yourself but then you don't want to put yourself in these positions if you're a lazy idiot you don't want to spend all your money on first class and then go home and go to sleep because then you're going to end up broke yeah so you have to know within yourself if you're the kind of person who knows you're going to try your absolute best all the time and you're going to find a way to succeed then yeah so you were you were never big at saving money I don't think I've ever saved money in my life I don't save money now if I have if I had money in the bank it's because I accidentally didn't spend it if I get paid hundreds of millions of dollars and I and I haven't managed to spend spend it all then I guess I've saved but I didn't I didn't think well let me take this a bit and put this here no I accidentally saved because I've run out of things to buy after 59 supercars and all these houses and 20 diamond watches and you buy them all cash yeah all cash I don't I don't have any Finance any loans on anything when you when now I own everything I could possibly ever desire I guess I accidentally save money it's an accident there's nothing left to buy there's nothing left to buy I focus on making as much as possible I have zero concerns for saving it's not something that really crosses my mind reinvesting or Investments was that something you thought of I mean clearly not early on when you're buying Rolex and this this is another thing that's interesting because if you're successful at any business you end up in the real estate business because you have to put your money somewhere exactly so you end up buying a bunch of houses because there's nothing else to buy you have to and people often broke people will sit and say oh if I was rich I'd just buy a few houses and then I'd have a house here and house there a cash flow not understanding those houses need to be maintained and there's property taxes and there's work and your tenant rent you with AK47s and kick him out it's headache it's work and then it's International broke people always say I'd have a house in Spain and a house in Miami oh I'm sure you would and what happens when your house in Spain is broken into and you don't visit it for six months and it's full of squatters doing heroin like it's it's it's work these Investments yeah so real estate's a headache and then a lot of other things on paper which is not even real money the stocks bonds all these garbage things on pieces of paper they're great if you can find a way to keep hold of them because please remember at any point in time it's the same with real estate to be honest at any point in time a judge who you've never heard of can stamp a piece of paper and decide that you don't belong you don't deserve your things you've worked for anymore they don't belong to you you can buy a whole bunch of stocks and bonds in real estate and then you can piss the government off and then whichever agency can go to a judge and say you're a bad person and the judge who's never met you who doesn't give a [ __ ] we stamp an order to confiscate confiscate your wealth and there'll be a new piece of paper that comes to your door and says this house you paid for ain't yours now and you'll say what was that then so you don't even own any of that gold is hard to transport it's heavy so what what cash is difficult you can't really deal with cash anymore yeah there are some things I've found but I Andre T's invest I have to wait until I free from The Matrix attack if I tell you what I found they're going to look for it right you have to think out inside the box I mean but real estate is great but you have to sit and understand that what type of real estate can you talk about that that you'd invest I can talk about this if you're a man with balls you're going to piss your government off and when you piss your government off they're going to come and take your house and if you're sitting here saying no I'm not going to piss my government off Andrew because I'm not going to get famous on the internet and tell them they're all idiots like you do because I'm a lot more sensible than you well I will say the following sir when they come with Co 2.0 and they tell you to put a m mask on and you don't put it on and you get a fine for not putting on your mask a $200 fine and you refuse to pay that $200 fine because you know it's injust they will go and put it to a bay lift and they'll put the fine up they'll add more money on top and they'll put a court date on it and they'll continue to amplify this fine until it's in the thousands and thousands and you'll refuse to pay it and then you'll go to court in front of a judge and you'll explain to the judge why you didn't pay it and the judge will tell you you should have paid it because it's public health and it's very important you'll say I'm not going to pay this this is garbage I don't have to wear a mask of a full-grown man and eventually you'll get to a point where they say fine we're going to settle this debt you owe us we're going to take your house that's what's going to happen look at Canada if you don't believe me look at the truckers who tried to stand up for Freedom they all lost their houses lost their pets had their dogs euthanized no one talks about it anymore yeah everyone just forgot oops so you don't own anything anyway you don't own the house you don't own the Investments you don't own anything but your heart and your soul and who you are you don't own anything but your faith in God and you own the skill skills you learn along the way the best investment you could do if you're a kid and you managed to make $5 million is reinvest in learning how to speak properly dress properly train get a personal trainer learn how to fight be strong be interesting and then go suffer somewhere go to Tibet and live in a a monk go live in a with a bunch of monks for six months and come back with some stories that's worth $5 million because it's hard to take from you unless they put you in jail you are now worth money you are but for you to buy a $5 million house and go I've got an investment great you have an investment as long as you shut up if you shut up and be a [ __ ] you own an investment congratulations and as the enslavement continues as it gets worse and worse the barrier of or the the the parameter of what you're going to be allowed to say is going to get Tighter and Tighter and Tighter right now we can argue sit here and make fun of people who say men can get pregnant our grandchildren's grandchildren will not be able to argue that point it'll be an accepted fact that men can get pregnant and if you argue against it you're a bigot and you're dangerous and your QR code on your forehead will be scanned by the facial recognition camera on the corner to let everyone know that you it'll come up somewhere on a billboard bigot bad person the AI machine will let everybody know that you're a thought criminal that's what's going to come so you have to be very prepared for these things and trying to invest money is actually one of the most stressful things in my life it's stressful for me it's kind of interesting I've gone from completely broke to looking at my to look I don't have a bank to to seeing some money somewhere in the the millions and millions and millions of dollars and realizing that I don't want to leave it liquid I need to put it somewhere and trying to find a place I can put it where it won't be stolen from me yeah it's hard it's harder than people think it's not easy yeah there's nothing what do you do with it it's difficult and then you realize you need all these complicated legal structures and Frameworks and you you need to get lawyers from seven countries and accountants and you have to go through all this iido and back flips and insanity just to try and protect your assets protect anything yeah it's it's a crazy world and and that's why it always makes me laugh when people who have no money say I had your money I'd just sit on a beach and I'd buy a few houses and live off the rental income I never thought of that genius oh wow you're so smart no wonder you're broke so you think it's better to focus on the business like I think it's better to focus on yourself I think it's better to focus on who you are I mean if you live behind a a brand or if there's a brand you can reinvest in your business reinvest in your brand yeah that's fine but if you learn how to speak correctly that's always going to be a net benefit if you're as strong as physically possible that'll always be a net benefit if you have interesting stories of suffering if you can go through things that other people can't go through that will always be a net benefit if you have a strong network of people who know things and have connections perhaps you know a guy who owns a bank in Lithuania then that's going to be a net benefit so if you get a bunch of money and you want to invest your first investment should be in a personal trainer and training as hard as possible going out there and suffering in some way trying to join a private members Club so you can get access to people actually have importance in the world you need to invest in yourself because it's it's hard to take things from you yeah you become ass cuz I'm mean I know I can never go broke because I'm me if if I if they allow me to talk unless they cut out my tongue I'll make money there will always be a company who will pay me to mention them so I'm fine because I'm me how do you think the story ends with you the Matrix because there's so much heat on you I can't imagine a world where a year from now 2 years 5 years 10 years from now people people don't forever know the name Andrew Tate yeah you know Escaping The Matrix is there a world where you're left alone and they go well we just let him go there's no jail there's no people trying like how do you see it ending in a in a semi- peaceful way where I don't think a lot of it's up to me it's up to Allah absolutely since to dawn of human time if you were a kingdom if you were a king you had a kingdom and your kingdom was under attack so there's no such thing as having an Empire without being attacked it doesn't matter if you were the ultimate Empire it doesn't matter if you were the British Empire if you had an Empire the fringes of your empire were constantly being tested and you constantly being attacked so the attacks come with the success I think that is a universal concept I think that there is a global Awakening of Consciousness happening right now as we speak which is going to make it harder for them to attack me I feel like certain political decisions depending which presidents win and which direction Society goes will depend on how big of a Public Enemy I remain M I think current legal case I'm going to win but I think it was a warning shot we believe in you brother thank you bro I think it was a warning shot and I think if they hit if they hit me again they won't let me off and I don't think people at home understand that when a Judicial decision affects the reputation of Nations it's not just about whether the person is innocent or guilty anymore if you have a person who will affect the public Consciousness in regard to believing in the mainstream media and affect the reputation of an entire Sovereign Nation depending on whether he goes to jail or is innocent they don't sit there and think is he innocent or not they sit there and think what's the Fallout for this person to walk if we let him go let him go it's not even about you anymore about it's about setting an example if someone tries to be as loud as Andrew it's about so many things bigger than your innocence right they can look and say well he is Innocent but this country will look bad this government will look bad this uh Federal agency will look bad this MSM will look bad he's going to be more powerful than ever he's going to have more influence people are going to believe what he says he's going to be able to cause this much trouble they don't even look at innocence anymore they look at the consequences of your innocence and then they decide well you know what there's too much Fallout for him to be innocent so he has to be guilty yeah it's not about law people don't understand this I think I'll beat this one but I think it's a warning Shaw and I think that they're going to if I if I continue to upset them they're going to come again and that one won't beat because they won't let me I think this was this one they're going to do relatively fairly fair I say fair as if I haven't suffered enough but they're going to consider this a warning shot warning shot Andrew only three months in a Romanian dungeon and five months on house arrest and all of your assets stolen and two and a half years and $1 million in legal fees and that's your warning shot yeah mess with us again you're going to that room you're not getting out that's what I believe is going to happen which will be a fun story because we both know I'm not going to shut up how do you sleep at night with this kind of pressure I don't I don't feel like I have any other choice for the same reason you can walk outside knowing you might get struck by lightning because I don't feel like if I shut up I would be a happy person I don't feel like that's who I am so I feel like I have to tell the truth of what I believe and I'm just going to have to suffer the consequences of it I don't feel like I have an option if I had a choice perhaps I'd be sitting in bed at night worried about should I do this but because I know I have to do it MH you have to go outside lightning might strike you it is what it is so the pressure is there and it's real and I'm sure there's going be a day I end up in a jail for a very long time and I'm going to perhaps consider the idea of regret for a fraction of a second I'll consider the possible idea of regret but it's not who I am knowing you know what I know I know I know what's going to come I just I've just I've resigned to it it's fine it's fine it's it's part of my story and it's going to make a great story so do it do it the worst thing they could do is kill me now just proves me right I'm not going to I'll be dead go on kill me you resigned to it I I I what's the point in being alive as a man if you don't live as for anything bigger than yourself anyway am I going to live for myself and just hedonistically what eat ice cream like a girl oh I'm rich now so I'm just going to eat ice cream all day no I'm G to tell the truth and if if I've to suffer for it then that's the consequences it's fine I love that now I want to talk a little bit about um family and obviously it's a very sensitive topic but I'm curious for you you know I know you have kids what are ways in which you recommend people um not necessarily that like you know you're the all and all be all how they should but just your personal philosophies on raising kids in you know particularly a western world as the Western world starts to influence with the internet the rest of the world what are some things that you'd recommend for people who have kids in terms of how to raise them to protect them from the moral degradation of society it's difficult it's really hard because you're fighting a war against the Matrix and they have more hours with your child than you ever will yeah you need to have strong Creeds within your household you need to have strong Creeds amongst you and your spouse and you need to make it very clear and create your child's reality because if you're just going to allow them to be raised by the school system and YouTube you're going to be very disappointed with the child they end up being and like most things it takes a degree of effort and it also needs you to understand that your influence for 20 minutes a day can't often Trump the influence of 12 hours a day of [ __ ] school and the internet and it goes down to the same things we said earlier I don't think most parents are too stupid to counteract the programming I think they're too lazy or too arrogant they're too lazy to bother trying to deprogram their children from The Matrix mind they've learned or they're too arrogant to believe they should have to they sit and think oh no my kid will be fine they know I don't believe in these things well you don't talk to your kid very much you're working they're watching this crap on YouTube all day so it's extremely difficult you need to create the reality like everything in life you need to work for it nothing in life comes easy you need to sit and work and dedicate yourself it's different for my level of Finance than it is for the average person the average person has a harder job if I wanted to make sure my kid was wasn't raised with LGBT Insanity I would send them to school in Saudi I can do that I'm rich why Saudi well they're it's an Islamic country and what did we talk earlier about religion and how they know what's right and they know what's wrong but I am rich most average people can't just send their kids to any a school in Malaysia or Saudi or Indonesia or any country that they believe would teach them the things they want to learn so it's a very difficult thing to do it takes work and it takes effort and I think most most parents would know how to do it they're not too stupid they're just too lazy or they're too and your child is susceptible and it's going to adhere to a power structure there's a power vacuum inside of their mind and inside of their soul and they're going to adhere to a power structure they end up respecting if they don't respect you and your gravitas they're going to end up respecting the school system and we know what garbage that is and YouTube and we know what garbage that is so good luck did having children or daughter change you in any way having children is so remarkably easy I heard everyone talk about how difficult it was but then I obviously after having kids I wasn't surprised by most people find everything difficult the gym is difficult making money is difficult waking up is difficult not being a lazy idiot is difficult having kids is easy you make sure that they don't eat too much food and you make sure they do as you as you say and you make sure they say please and thank you I I'm I'm I'm not trying to belittle it but how difficult is it to raise a three-year-old mhm say thank you thank you okay sit down sit down quiet okay mhm how do you struggle with that maybe some people do you people struggle with everything I I don't know people can people struggle to be anything in life having kids is remarkably easy and it's a blessing there's nothing better than raising children did did it soften your heart or did you find like yourself like growing in terms of the tenderness with the child or any of that I always knew I'm a soft person I'm a nice person I I get that vibe from you people have a judgment like they judge you as a whole based on your political philosophies and that's who Andrew is as a whole you know they miss the of course tenderness of course but as a man if you don't have that edge if you don't have that competitive or combative Edge then what's the point of being tender at all anyway what's the point of me loving my kid if I won't kill the people who try and hurt her right what's the point I I mean maybe there's some men out there who are weak and would say oh I'm really loving okay that's great until [ __ ] hits the fan then your love's worth nothing my love's worth something because I'll go charge at gunfire Your Love isn't worth anything if you're not combative as a man then your love means nothing anyway mhm so you need to have that edge to you I love my children absolutely but I'm also not going to take any crap from them or anyone else I'm not going to negotiate with a child right my child are going to do as I say and they're going to be versions of me the masculine version or the feminine version of me and they're going to be raised to my Creeds how I believe they should be raised they're not the government's kids and they're not YouTube's kids and they're not school's kids they're mine and if I say something is right and wrong that's how they're going to act and I'm not apologizing for that I'm not sitting here saying people say to me what if they don't want to what if they want to be different what do you mean they what if they they're seven since when do they get to decide how the world works at seven at seven I was an idiot so I know better for the same reason I won't let them put their plug their finger in a plug socket I'm not going to let them do anything else unless I agree with it call me authoritarianism call me bad person whatever they're going to call me but this is how children were raised for the longest period of human time and I think that's that's why families stayed families that's why families had honor because they were raised to be a particular way because of the Creed of their last name that's how it's supposed to be and my children will do the exact same thing what about your mom what does she say she's proud of me she's worried she's concerned like a mother should be she tries to calm me down and say is this all worth it but that's the feminine frame the feminine frame is always to try and avoid the war like I said earlier on to drag you back from Battle because they want to keep you safe that's how women operate and that's what they're good at and that's their role but I'm a man now and I tell her look I've got under control everything's fine I take care of her she's very well looked after and she's just going to have to let me go I mean she she said I'm glad I have strong Sons I couldn't deal with all this mess if you weren't strong and I said well this mess wouldn't exist if I wasn't strong I'd be working in Starbucks full of vaccine yeah so you wouldn't have you'd have to worry about something else you'd have to worry about me having a random heart attack or not being able to pay your bills you always have to worry about something Mom at least you have to only worry about my well I say only you you have to worry you don't have to worry about your bills being paid you don't have to worry about my competence you have to worry about them allowing me to survive but the other way around you'd have to worry about me getting up each day without wanting to shoot myself in the head because I'm a minimum wage wagy at 40 so there's there's no there's no way out war is certain for all of us we're all fighting different battles you can either suffer the intense pain it requires to become a somebody or and suffer the intense pain of being a forever nobody yeah it's your choice yeah the pain of dis sper the pain of regret oh absolutely just Pain's there yeah there's no doubt about it yeah choose your heart absolutely absolutely now what about Tristan what are Tristan's thoughts on this I'm sure Tristan goes Andrew why you doing all this [ __ ] man we could be living it up I mean you know what Tristan doesn't say that you know what Tristan actually thinks the whole thing is super funny and hilarious he thinks the whole thing is hilarious yeah Tristan just laughs his way through all of it just just funny I'm a human trafficker you're a human trafficker haha and just laughs out loud calls himself a human trafficker to everyone thinks it's funny holding is a big joke and it is a joke it's clown world it's clown world and I'm trying to fix it and fight against it he's accepted it's clown world and is enjoying the show and you guys have always had a strong Brotherhood there was never all the time we weren't allowed to do anything else my father wouldn't allow it yeah that's how we were raised because I heard you guys like shared bank accounts did everything together supported each other women the whole thing always we've always been a team we've always had each other's back doesn't matter what it was and I think that that's the way men were initially raised and supposed to be I think men have always operated that way I think masculine strength comes from fraternity from Brotherhood it's one of the reasons why it's under attack it's one of the reasons why they don't want people to be that way anymore even you talked about women even if we had a heartbreak or a woman left us or whatever it couldn't affect us properly like it affected most people because we were busy with our brother having a great time so we've always had that unity and that's a huge source of strength I love that man and then I want to ask two more questions and then we have a quick game and then we're done cool is when the and Tate Legacy is complete right and you're dead gone and nothing but a pile of dust as inevitably we all will be what do you hope the Andrew Tate Legacy was all about well I'm sure I wasn't right about everything perhaps only 99.9% but I would like people to understand that I took the brave option always that I had a bunch of other ways out I never sold my soul or coward like everyone else did there's a reason why people with influence don't talk but I continue to talk and I think that's obvious to people at home now because I'm suffering the consequences and as long as people will acknowledge I at least made the brave Choice even if they disagree with the choices I made then I'd be pretty happy because I think that all the men of history history that we remember were Brave even if they made some decisions that were questionable or not everyone agreed with they were known as Brave and I think that bravery is one of the most basic tenants of masculinity which is lacking in the world today a lot of people agree with the things I say or think things similar but are afraid to say them I I think bravery is one of the most important elements required to crack the Matrix and defeat them so the brave Choice perhaps I'll put that on my gravestone the brave Choice we'll see now last question I have is you know a lot of people look up to your story they look up to the philosophies you share people have their own dreams Ambitions what's your best advice for people looking up to you and a lot of people try to use business as a vehicle to escape their own you know you talked about your humble beginnings a lot of people have their own unique version of that yeah what's Andrew Tate's best advice to make your dreams a reality to to beat the Matrix to to break the chains of where most people are born and R their dreams sure I'll give my best advice my best advice is to stop trying to do anything by yourself because you're competing against teams who not how well yeah you're never going to be able to outc compete a team by yourself this whole idea of Rambo lone soldier is garbage I can even talk about me I make a lot of money with a lot of people I have hundreds of people effectively I work with in different areas in different regards I have a very large team of competent men I'm a competent man and I know hundreds of competent men and we're all pushing in One Direction how can you as one person with your limited human time and space and energy out compete us you can't you need to find people you can rely on and Trust which is actually the most difficult thing because especially when money's involved you'll start to learn that that's hard but if you can build a true fraternity of people who are on your side you can trust with your life you can do amazing things Jesus did amazing things with 12 12 disciples it's amazing what you can do with a Few Good Men you're not going to be able to do it by yourself so it starts with Brotherhood it starts with shared Vision it starts with shared dedication it starts with Creeds and Ethos within that friendship group that allow you to be the strongest most fearsome version of yourself everyone talks about the fact that you are the sum of The Five People You spend the most time with but then nobody Cates the five people they spend time with they forget the second part of the equation if you only hang around with Killers you'll be a killer and if you get a good team together it's nearly impossible to fail it's nearly impossible to fail if you're a good team all pushing in the same direction I don't even think it's that difficult to do you just need to be the kind of person who's waking up around people who are not allowing you to be anything other than your best self and then you're going to win profound and how important is delegation team building a lot of people struggle with that early on well a lot of people a lot of people struggle with delegation because they're lazy and they hire mercenaries so a lot of people will come along and say I want to start a business I'm going to be the face of it and then I'm going to hire this guy to do this this this this this and that's fine but then you have people who are only working for a paycheck and if you're the face of it but they don't respect how much you have suffered to be the face of it which ties back into something I said earlier then they don't think you deserve that position of being the face of it why are they doing all the nitt G and then you have resentment and then you have problems within the team if you had a leader who suffers and charges head first at the gunfire like the General on his horse first it inspires the troops behind and if they believe in the miss Mission and they're not doing it purely for a paycheck but because they believe in the mission that's how you fight that's how you have the most powerful Army possible in like days of old so delegation is very possible but you have to be careful hiring mercenaries because mercenaries are only there for the paycheck you need people who have the same vision as you the same obligation as you the same Duty as you and will benefit from the results shared ownership there's a lot of things you can do but I think a lot of it is down to ethos and culture more than even just delegation I I don't have anyone works for me purely for a paycheck I would argue that most people who work for me I say I'm not paying you next month they'd say cool whatever and just continue to do their job they didn't care you got a A1 team around you and I know a big part of it too is family right absolutely how important has that been for you yeah I I my cousins my my brother a lot of the men in my family we all work together people say you shouldn't mix family and business but I strongly disagree especially if you have a good family life and you already have a good hierarchy within the family then it gets even better but we all do our jobs and we all do them flaw ly and I do believe you have to lead from the front I'm the first person up I'm the last person to sleep and that's why I get to yell at anyone who doesn't do their job properly so it's easy for me to run my billion dollar company because I work hardest and I'm always going to do that I have no problem doing that and I think that's how it should be you know Fitness is a big part of the mind so for me one of the things I'm working on now is my fitness Y how important has Fitness been because it seems like it's been a reoccurring theme throughout your life to be physically fit the mind gets a strong um you know when you strengthen the body you strengthen the mind how important has physical fitness been into your success your mindset your growth making millions of dollars having the impact you have like what role has Fitness played in that for you I can answer that question in lots of ways the first one that is the simple one of strong body is a strong mind secondly there's a lot of discipline required in Fitness and discipline can be applied to you universally to All Things discipline is a skill you can pull out of your pocket and apply to anything you can force yourself to do something you don't want to do because you're disciplined not because you're motivated like we said earlier on not because you feel like doing it but because you're supposed to do it thirdly this is something that not many other people say so I'm going to say it there is a unspoken rule amongst men and it I remember a few weeks ago maybe a few months ago there were women on Twitter or women on the internet saying when men meet do they always think about the possibility of violence does that cross their mind and and they were surprised by that fact that if men who I mean we met for a podcast but if you meet men in an unfriendly scenario or you don't know who they are a first fraction of your a second you're thinking can I win this fight are they going to attack me it crosses our minds we live in a very Physical Realm sure any man who doesn't has been polluted by The Matrix and will never be competitive and is doomed to fail but if you're truly competitive like you should be as a Mana always crosses your mind and one of the important things about physical fitness that most people never talk about never say is men treat you different when when they know that you'd be hard to hurt life treats you different women certainly do that's an obvious one right women like musly guys because musly guys are can fight obviously that's not the case but that's how they look dangerous right but men also treat you differently which means society's a whole treat you differently I would argue that if you wanted to run any kind of company or even do sales or do anything else let's say let's go back to sales let's talk about what we were saying earlier if I want to sell windows and I came in in fantastic physical condition the person who's buying from me one knows I'm disciplined and two knows I'm diligent that's going to be some massive advantages from my sales perspective right but also I would argue that men are happy to look up to somebody who is physically strong in a in a different regard I think it would be difficult for you to be a true leader unless you showed some degree of physical prowess I think that's just the way the world has always worked on a on a a deep level when a man looks at a guy who's 6'8 and jacked and he says we're going to go into battle you're more motivated to go into battle beside him because he's 6'8 and jacked you feel like you're going to win you like the idea of being led by a warrior right so there's that huge element to it as well and and the final part of it all is that it's so much easier to keep something than it is to gain something and once you're in good physical shape it's actually so easy to maintain as opposed to ever get there it's so hard to get there that if you ever get there you may as well just keep it right it's because it's so easy to keep as opposed to lose and I think it's in in today in today's world it's also a huge state symbol because we live in a world now where most things can be bought you can buy Instagram followers and you can hire a Lambo and you can buy a hot chick to stand next to you but you can't yet buy perfect physical conditioning MH that is showing the world that you did it one rep at a time it's earned you have to earn it and it's one of the few things left that has to be earned the hard way that you can't buy which I think is also very important we can also continue to answer this question because you're going to feel different you feel different as a man when you know you can and I'm a peaceful man but when you know if things happened or if someone tried to hurt the woman next to you you could destroy the man who's trying to do it you feel different there's an aura that people can smell the woman can smell it Predators can smell it maybe perhaps if I was built differently I would have been treated differently in jail good point yeah but everybody looked at me and they knew who I was and they thought m that's that's messy not him that's it's just how humans work yeah right and it's just how the whole universe works it's how the animal kingdom works even lions and tigers as fearsome as they are go for the weakest Antelope they don't want hard fight they just want to eat right even mating Partners yeah how 100% so Society is the same I'm I'm sure there's scenarios in my life where I've walked down a street and I've been left alone and the person who walked behind after me or few seconds later cuz he wasn't built like I was was the one who got mugged I'm sure that's happened at some point in my life but I'm the Hard Target and I like feeling like the Hard Target and I and I think that I approach life differently knowing I'm the Hard Target yeah so someone said it smarter than I I don't know if it was Plateau or or one of those ancient Greek philosophers he said what a shame for a man to grow old without ever knowing the true power his body is capable of and I completely agree wow Aristotle perhaps one of those really smart men but yeah and that's also one of the the true beauties of being a man is being physically strong MH I I'm now I'm trying to think would I tra would I trade what would I trade my my physical prowess for I'm not sure there's not much that could tempt me I I I and and once you it's kind of like being rich once you become rich you get used to it and you don't appreciate it but if you lost all of your money you would be miserable and you'd know I didn't appreciate it when I had it now I want it back I had it all and I lost it I I wasted it I think physical prowess is the same thing it's something I take for granted all of the time but even if I look at jail if I look how some of the smaller prisoners were being treated the fact that nobody even tried to treat me that way yeah it's it's intangible all right and then what's the biggest misconception people have that you've seen being on this side of the fence about you that you think most people don't understand do people have deliberate misconceptions I'm not sure they do I think the people who don't understand me have sorry I'll reword that I don't think people have misconceptions unless it's deliberate the people who misunderstand me have deliberately misunderstood me because they don't like my Monumental successes and there's a degree of envy and jealousy and they want to try and tear down my character because there's nothing else they can attack me with they can't call me dumb they can't call me unsuccessful can't call me weak can't call me St there's nothing else to call me besides a bad person I think it's deliberate misconceptions which they are deliberately holding on to because there's a huge Envy factor involved in all of these things hate always comes from below and no matter what I say to them they're not going to change their mind and I have very little interest in changing their mind because there's no light without dark and one of the reasons I'm so monumentally successful is because every time I say anything there's a huge public discourse around it so it's fine by me I need the idiots they're effectively free staff they work for me and they amplify my message endlessly so I appreciate them and they do it for free and they dedicate their lives sitting there getting upset talking about me giving me their human time and energy eating food to burn into calories to talk about Andrew Tate and they think if they put it in a negative way it somehow harms me and it does the absolute opposite so they can keep their misconceptions what would your final words be to the world final words of wisdom my unmatch perspicacity coupled with sheer indefatigability makes me a feared opponent in any realm of human endeavor say that one more time my unmatched pacity coupled with sheer in fatigability makes me a feared opponent in any realm of human endeavor beautiful my man thanks G and then at the end top G my man it's a privilege at the end we play a little word relation game so it's a very simple game we wrap up pods with this I can feel it don't worry all right let's go we can edit how you like so so I'm going to Rifle off a quick word or phrase could be a person could be an idea just your first intuitive response it could be short it could be quick the Only Rule is that you can't repeat yourself okay ready ready all right money power your brother best friend God I'm G say scary religion I don't want to break the rules but you ask me these words and I can only think of very long answers let it flow it's okay let it flow religion is Rel humans have always been religious and I just want to say when you talk about religion I I was going to say imperative and the reason I'll say that is not because I believe that well I do believe people need to believe in God but there is no one on earth who doesn't have a religion and if you don't believe in God then you're believing in government or LGBT or communism or some garbage there's nobody on Earth that doesn't have a religion and I think religion should be God as opposed to pretending you're an atheist and then worshiping your government who taxes you to Oblivion instead there's nobody who is not religious there are just people who believe in different things The Matrix I can hear all the the conveyor belt of of words and phrases and ideas I'm gon to say it's necessary and I know that's a strange answer for most people but we're human beings always resort to a form of order even if that order is tyrannical because without order there's chaos and I don't think humans actually like the idea of chaos the reason dictators stay in power in these countries is because if you remove the dictator it just becomes Warlords Waring tribes and gang wars and no one likes the idea of their children getting shot in the street by random gang and there's no repercussion there's no law there's no order there's nothing they can do about it besides go out there and die themselves against the gang I think humans naturally inclin towards order and that's broken as the Matrix is it is a form of order for the people who are prepared to be slaves I'm not and there's a lot of men out there who are not prepared to be slaves anymore but it does keep a degree of Law and Order amongst Society for now and I don't think it's going to last much longer however a version of The Matrix is always going to be to some degree necessary the afterlife Serene president Trump he's Brave Elon Musk he's Brave too but I can't use the same word twice Elon what one word do I use for Elon word or phrase it's okay a lot I can say about Elon I think he's done fantastic things in terms of cracking the Matrix he's certainly been orchest been a huge orchestrator of it to give him credit I'm gonna have to think about what word i' I'd give Elon because you could say brave but I think it's something more than that I think he's cunning I think he knows what he's doing at a deeper level than most understand Biden tired what do they call him sleepy Joe yeah the future I would say dystopian and I'll also say I'm GNA say dystopian but I don't believe it's for everybody I think the world is cyclical and we're going to soon be returning to a version of History where there were Kings and there were surfs there were peasants and there were Lords and rulers and I think that this AI systems are going to implement are going to keep a lot of people very firmly in their place social Mobility will be removed and if you're not rich your chance of getting rich will be zero if you're not free your chance of becoming free will be zero you and your entire bloodline will be enslaved forever in your 15minute city but there's going to be people living outside the Matrix who will live better than ever before and I think that the world's just going to get more divided with the rich becoming richer and the poor becoming poor the free becoming more free and those who are currently confined Ed by their finances or their geographical location are soon going to be completely enslaved divided perhaps is the word freedom I think it's a decision because I felt free in jail because I had I I knew I'd made the the decisions although the decisions I made put me there I knew they were the right decisions to make peace of mind a luxury being top G stressful the key to getting women for men out there wondering key to getting women competence they like men who can get things done your biggest insecurity we talked about this earlier didn't we what is my biggest insecurity not having any yeah I'm not sure I'm GNA have to think of one for the next podcast part two I I'll come back with a whole list of insecurities I'll see if I can find any but like I I don't operate under that Paradigm I don't operate under that frame there could be something glaringly wrong with me MH and I refuse to operate under that frame I don't think it's advantageous I think I'm most competitive if I don't operate under the frame of this is bad about me so I don't have any best advice you've ever been given best advice I've ever been given I've had a lot of good advice but I heard this someone reminded me of this Only Yesterday I heard it many years ago and they reminded me of it yesterday and they said never scare a powered because they're going to do the most heinous things to get revenge worst advice you've ever been given Follow Your Passion it's garbage the man who made money with concrete was not passionate about concrete he just wanted to win your passion should be winning at any cost a lot of people say to me I want to do a business I'm passionate about I said yeah girls want to open flower shops but guess what flower shops don't make girls Rich so fulfillment children children yeah next word was children ah smart and uh Andrew Tate in 2024 and 2025 hopefully free be nice to have a couple years of free in between the incarcerations we'll see how it goes and the last one Andre Tate 10 years from now not sure I don't think that far ahead but perhaps I should start but I don't myself the luxury if I'm alive in 10 years from now my intention is to have 20 Sons so I can raise the future generation of troublemakers to The Matrix that John Connor some andate Junior fight against Skynet and I haven't got 20 yet but we're getting there and then I know we mentioned it earlier but I got to ask again when you're dead gone and nothing but a pile of dust what do you hope the world remembers Andrew Tate has Brave is the word I I I'm going to stick with I made the brave Choice every time there was a choice on my table between left and right and I wasn't sure which one to choose I chose the one which took the most bravery and what it means to be one of the passionate feel it's the name of the podcast so you don't own anything in this world but your soul anyway and what is a soul without passion right so uh I'm quite blessed to be honest regard irregardless of what happens to me I'm glad there's something I feel is worth standing up for I think there'd be nothing worse than living a life where you didn't feel anything was worth risking yourself for what's the point in being alive oh man Andrew thank you so much for being on the show brother bro top G I appreciate you man thank you hope you enjoyed the podcast brother absolutely thank you very much absolutely thank you guys
