foreign [Music] and I deserve to be yeah most people don't deserve to be proud of themselves yeah and that's the truth a lot of people say oh you know I have confidence issues and I say if I was you I would have confidence issues of course I don't I completely understand why you have confidence issues you're a dork but we have to be realistic here we have to be absolutely not only realistic because the world is brutal and as harsh if you're not proud of yourself you probably don't deserve to be proud of yourself so you're not going to feel happy and you just talked about confidence confidence comes from competence the reason I'm confident is because I'm good at everything right I'm good at everything I do the things I'm not good at I'm not confident in of course and I know what they are I don't do them very often I've now created my reality to the point where I don't do anything I'm not good at you are you're just higher I you're higher I just don't want to do it like I I don't play darts yeah I'm not good at darts right right I do what I'm do what I'm good at so yeah I'm absolutely not really confident because I'm absolutely not really competent and that takes practice and discipline and motivation and you need to fail a few times you need to get up and like I said earlier when I learned my entire mindset in professional fighting and chess the two combined that's how it comes down to and when people say oh you know I have competence issues usually I can look them up and down and say yeah if I was you I would completely and hardly struggle with confidence issues because you're the world is competitive and there's men like me on the planet and friends like mine on the planet and you're competing against us for for money for girls for state is for resource and you're going to be destroyed and decimated the entire time so of course you have confidence issues when you can be annihilated in real time by the competitor why why wouldn't you have confidence issues you'd be Psychopathic not to yeah that makes sense so maybe that that unconfidence is a good motivation for them well it's supposed to be this is the thing that I don't I don't truly understand if I'm happy with something and I'm uncomfortable with something that I fix it yeah that's endless motivation which I don't truly believe in as a concept but that's endless fuel for the fire right if I was unhappy with something about myself regardless of what it was I would be able to take all of that discomfort and turn it into endless energy to get the problem fixed exactly but these people seem to something to be unhappy yeah well these people seem to sit and say I'm really I'm really unhappy with X but then stay doing X so I don't believe they're truly actually unhappy what you'll notice if you live life long enough is that somebody will sit and say to you I'm unhappy being a loser you say why are you a loser I just sit at home play video games seven days a week and you're like okay and maybe three days of the week they're unhappy doing that and that's the time they email you and that's the time they want to make a change but four days of the week they don't really it doesn't really bother them yeah it doesn't really bother them because if if it bothered them seven days a week guess what they would fix it correct so I have very little sympathy for people and that's not because I'm not a nice person but it's because I've been so hard on myself and I've been through so many things that were difficult and I've been through so much pain and Trauma myself some of it self-inflicted some of it given to me by God to make me a better person but I've been I've been so difficult on myself it's very hard for me to look at somebody who's refused to be difficult on themselves and see them as my equal or feel sympathy or pity for them why would I feel pity for somebody who took the easy route when I took the hardest possible route I took the hardest possible way to be the man I am and you were too big of a and now you want me to feel sorry for you I don't feel sorry for you I don't feel sorry for these people and because as I'm man you can be anything you decide you want to be that's the beauty of being a male you can build your character completely from the ground up just like a video game every single thing about me that people respect I built I was not born a world champion kickboxer I was not born this intelligent or an intellectual I was not born this rich I was not born this strong I was not born this confident I was not born this interesting I was not born as charismatic and humble and gorgeous and tall and strong and sexy although bored none of these things I became these things myself so I deserve all The Spoils of War and anybody who decides they don't want to work hard enough to become those things then they deserve to sit and accept their mind fear that's that's their problem when I didn't have enough money to buy whatever I wanted I couldn't fall asleep at night because I understood there are people out there that did and I didn't see them as better than me and I thought why are these people who I don't see as my Superior living in an experience that I can't live and it bothered me to the point where I could not sleep so yeah that was real when you talk about suffering mentally I don't really consider that suffering uh I did I have had a very painful life I still think to a degree I do but that's self-inflicted but I can't imagine living any other way I can't imagine living in this idea this utopian hahaha every day just you know girls drink Hedonism yeah it's degenerate I'm always I think the only thing you can do that's not to generate is usually be fighting a battle or solving a problem yeah growth yeah so you need to either fight a battle or solve a problem to avoid degeneracy which means I'm constantly looking for them I'm currently one of the largest battles on you can pulse a man can possibly take on I'm taking on The Matrix the most powerful people on the planet right yeah so yeah is my life difficult yeah uh am I complaining about that no in fact I'd hate you for it to be any other way I was now the oldest man alive in the Tate family I had to look after my mother and my siblings and take care of people I did I had to make a choice do I fly back to America and spend money and time and go to this funeral and you know waste a few weeks or do I sit here and just focus on this Enterprise and make sure that it cannot fail and we talked earlier about Speed most people go that you know it's only two weeks it's only a week it's only a week the people who say it's only a week are the people who are broke that's the reason you're all poor because you say it's only weak it's almost tomorrow oh I'll do it later it's only an hour it's only a day it's only a minute you're competing against people like me we do not waste a second so I had to make a decision and I decided that as the oldest man in the family it's more important I Achieve Financial stability for all of us than to go and pay respects to my father and his funeral because I paid respect to him every single day of his life and I pay respect to his memory every single day now and I pay respect to him by being monumentally successful the reason my father has talked about and discussed at length is because of the absolutely amazing Sun I've become I am keeping him alive forever by working so hard by becoming so unique and individual and fantastic and humble that's what I was taught to do I was upset obviously I was sad obviously I was heartbroken of course but I took all of that energy and I worked harder than I've ever worked I I worked 22 hour days for months because I couldn't sleep yeah and I became one of the most successful people on the planet
