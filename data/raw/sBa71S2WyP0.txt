with someone about how pointless the modern education system is i think the modern modern education system is nothing but an indoctrination machine i think they use it to indoctrinate the youth i think it's a waste of [ __ ] time what brainwashed people the brainwashed people of course they do and it's actually because i can talk forever the world's a spider's web right everything extrapolates from from everything else and most people are not capable of understanding that nearly every single idea or habit or lifestyle which is propagated mainstream by the matrix is done so with a trojan horse so even the educational meeting with a hidden agenda for the hidden agenda so even if you look at things like women's rights women need rights women protecting women should be equal under law completely agree they said they wanted women to work so people could pay more taxes no they want people to work so they could pay more taxes double the tax base but you know what else they wanted them to work for get the kids out of the get the kids out of the influence of the parents right when the woman's at home and the father's at work those women sorry those children are learning from the woman who's probably learning from the father and you get to instill your own beliefs in those children government doesn't want that the government wants the children to belong to them so they get the woman at the house and they send you to school for as long as possible to reprogram you this is why you will see youtube videos of children arguing with their parents and their parents say that's not true and the children will say i learnt in school that a man can be a zebra or whatever they learned and they start arguing with their own children you don't own your own children's minds anymore because your children's mind is owned by youtube and the school right and the school will say to you if your parents ever yell at you or get aggressive to you you come to me and we'll tell the police don't worry about that so they're doing it to brainwash the children right because this is how you control the future so the whole educational system in and of itself is a scam they use feminism and the whole women's rights [ __ ] to get everyone's children into the adulteration indoctrination machine they keep their you there as long as possible they want you to finish in debt because then you gotta get a [ __ ] job and become a good slave but they don't teach you anything of value nobody learns anything of value in school and everybody intrinsically knows this even the people who disagree with me i said if you see me pull up in my bugatti in a gas station do you look at me and think wow he went to school [ __ ] no nothing drug dealer gangster scammer you think i'm doing something illegal because you understand if i was staying within the paradigms of the system i couldn't have possibly achieved this the only way you can fathom i've done it is by imagining me as an outlaw because you know within the paradigms of society i shouldn't have even [ __ ] done it that's how much you know school's a scam you don't look at someone rich and respect them thinking he went to school the people you are learning from in school aren't even [ __ ] rich your business professors never had a business they're brokies they're [ __ ] broke so school's a scam and it's the biggest scam on earth and the reason it's a scam before i get into the metapoint the reason is to scam is because it operates in a vacuum it operates in a vacuum because it cannot be fairly compared to any other service so you can get a loan for school but you can't use that money for anything else because if they were to open it up and put the school the education system into the fair market of capitalism it would fail i've already give you 100 grand and say you can get a degree or you can buy a crypto or you can start your own business or you can do anything you want with it who's going to choose a degree no one from nobody so they say you can only get the money if you use it for education which allows it to operate inside of a vacuum because operates inside of a vacuum it is one of the few things on the planet which is allowed to be non-competitive it's not competitive against any other investment everyone knows that but you can only get the money for that so you can't get the money to invest in anything else so you end up doing it learning something that is outdated slow to learn there's more it doubly inflates there's more degrees every single year meaning the value of a degree decreases and the price goes up every single year so it's worth less each year it costs more year on year there's no other industry where you can even get away with that you get wrecked except the educational system so it's explaining why it's all a [ __ ] scam people say to me well what else am i supposed to do i don't know what else to do i said i'll say well i'll start school and my school will teach you how to make money because what do you want to work for i want to work for my passion today for your passion [ __ ] off what do you want to work for on work for money okay you're the guy i need you owner for money because there's people who really don't want to do what they enjoy that's fine you're never going to be rich that way go be a vet a vet you might be rich go work in the zoo and clean up pig [ __ ] cause you get to be near an elephant that's your thing go do it your passion has nothing to do with getting paid so the people who are serious people are smart enough to go i only work cause i want money i don't care what i do i just want money cool then you can come to my school now my school is competitive my school does not operate inside of a vacuum it's 49 a month for hustlers university and we teach 18 modern wealth creation methods we teach 18 different ways to make money in the modern world which is very different from the old world which is a key point because people always say well my parents told me your parents lived in a different [ __ ] world your parents bought a house for sixty thousand dollars and now it's worth half a million dollars so of course they're telling you to save up buy a house how you gonna buy a house for half a mill we're gonna starbucks gee they ain't gonna happen right so all your parents advice is outdated and it's [ __ ] so all the old advice is [ __ ] saving money is [ __ ] inflation's like ten percent save you gotta get rid of your money [ __ ] saving you gotta [ __ ] spend it so everything they tell you is is wrong and old so it's all modern wealth creation 18 different modern wealth creation methods it's 49 a month and you can spend that 49 anything you want you don't have to join my school you can go buy lunch if you want so i'm competing against the entire world right you can you can invest that in anything and people are still choosing my school that shows it has a genuine value at the point of this podcast where i checked this morning we have 108 000 students 108 000 students 108 000 in hustlers university correct whoa 108 000 isn't impressive that i've amassed it's impressive that i retain there are 108 000 people in the world who have joined my school for 49 a month and they say i am getting more for my money or more value than i'm investing here i'm either making more money back or i'm learning more than i would ever possibly learn for 49 anywhere else so i unlike traditional education genuinely compete in the world and i'm the only educational platform in the world that does this there's no competition at all and i do it because the people who join my school and listen actually make money now i've been accused of a bunch of [ __ ] there is an affiliate system you can make money with affiliates that is a system that does exist inside that's one of the 18 ways you don't have to just affiliate for h you can affiliate for amazon products which you try to affiliate for [ __ ] anything so you can affiliate with for a bunch of [ __ ] but there's 17 other ways to make money all inside of the school itself so we are the number one educational platform on the planet and i will say this now anybody who's serious about making money should be inside because 49 is not going to help you in any other way in your life because there's no crypto you're going to buy for 50 bucks it's going to blow up there's nothing else for 50 you have [ __ ] nothing to lose i'm not saying it's going to be easy no seems to be quick but we'll teach you how to make money if you're sitting ready to sit there and learn so that's what hate you is so i've got hate you in the war on the two biggest things online
