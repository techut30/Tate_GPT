thank you people will constantly tell you to not talk in a way which is full of conviction people do not like you to have the arrogant and have an ego this is the worst thing ever let me tell you a fact number one facet of the G mindset your life is never going to be worse if you walk through the world believing you are the [ __ ] man you wake up look in the mirror and go I'm the I'm the [ __ ] man I am the man there's no one on this planet who can do [ __ ] I couldn't do if I put my mind to it I don't give a [ __ ] how good you are at piano if I decide to play piano I would be better than you at piano and I believe that I don't just say these things I [ __ ] believe them and when you go through life believing you really really are the man there are very few downsides the downsides are everyone's gonna call you in arrogant everyone call you arrogant I was gonna call you a [ __ ] I was gonna say he has a big ego you're going to lose a few loser friends who cares what you are going to gain there's other people on the same path you mean other people think yeah well I'm the [ __ ] man too this guy's the man who's making some money that's what's gonna happen [Music] foreign even if you're not the man yet even before I was a world champion I knew I was going to be the man so I don't give a [ __ ] and I was happy to say that to anybody and people call me arrogant and stupid and deluded I just sit there and look at them and say yeah [ __ ] you I'm going to be first thing you have to believe for the [ __ ] man you can achieve anything and when I say that I don't want I'm gonna say that again have to believe you're the [ __ ] man and you have to believe you can achieve anything I'm not saying you can achieve anything easily I'm not saying it's not going to take a whole bunch of work I'm not saying it's going to happen quickly but you have to believe you can achieve anything tell you something now I don't give a [ __ ] them to be an astronaut I don't care about climbing Mount Everest you give me enough time to train I will get it done I know that for a fact because I know who I am as a man that's the first thing the second thing is you need to be perspicacious you need to understand that in this world there's a whole bunch of people doing amazing [ __ ] that you are not doing and that needs to piss you off because it pisses you off you become motivated all of a sudden I was the only one who's pissed off when that Aston Martin was next to him had my sales job I was the only one who's pissed off when I saw that Ferrari broadcast other people were not annoyed by it and they were not annoyed by it they're not driven to beat it you understand they're not driven to be where that person was you need to be annoyed and I'm telling you I'm telling you to be angry anger is a fantastic Force like I said the world tells you not to be arrogant tells you not to be angry it's two things it tells you to do don't be arrogant don't have an ego and you know you don't have anger you're a [ __ ] man you're a full-grown man just is perfectly fine for you to be pissed off it's perfectly fine if you look around in your life look at the girl you're [ __ ] look at the house you live in look at the car you drive and get pissed off and go you know what I want a heart [ __ ] I want a [ __ ] nicer house I want faster car there's nothing wrong if you take that anger and you direct it in the correct direction this is the reason I stop fighting now people go why do you stop fighting us because I fall and I went through hell to get everything I now have I had nothing left I had nothing and I wanted the life I now have now I wake up in one of my three mansions with one of my seven supervisors run my 15 women what do I need to fight for like people have different motivations with different things some Fighters out there and you fight for other reasons my motivation was I was pissed off at the world and now I'm not as angry as I used to be so I don't believe I was going to fight her as I used to do also works Mass I'm not as good as I'm used to it so that's how I decided to retire early but this is the second thing first thing with a man second thing you need to get angry about your situation you don't own the home you're in get pissed off is there a Ferrari on your drive get pissed off if you don't have 10 Playboy Bunny level Beauties get pissed off what the [ __ ] well you need to sit there and realize whoa whoa whoa I have a few years of Consciousness and even less than that I have a few short years as a young man because age will damage you I mean if you're a millionaire and you're 60 it's not nearly as good as being a millionaire at my age I became a million at 28. so you need to realize you've got a few short years as a young man you're [ __ ] wasting it we need to sit there and go [ __ ] [ __ ] get angry he's getting angry forced directed anger is an extremely powerful for us these are the first two attentions to do for achievements only person who gives a [ __ ] about your life truly is you and if you don't give a [ __ ] then you're [ __ ] but point two get angry you're gonna start giving a [ __ ] very soon and after you get angry you need to realize that nobody is going to give you the things you want it doesn't matter if Donald Trump is president or not infused Trump's man but it doesn't make a difference no politician is going to make you rich no one else is going to come along and say I'm going to concentrate my effort on fixing your life no way you have to understand you're out here alone absolutely your means when you understand these three things you start to see how a mindset comes together nobody's going to save you you're [ __ ] it's totally down with you pissed off with your current situation and you want to change it plus you believe you can do absolutely relief this is how I thought at 18 years old because at a very young age when I had my Prime resource of energy and power 18 19 years old I understood those three tenets I believe I can do anything I'm pissed off I don't have the life I want and nobody else is going to give it to me these are three things you need to understand if any one of these elements is missing you'll never have the right mindset the G mindset will never formulate in any one of these elements is missing all three are absolutely essential and the sooner you get your act together the sooner you start to panic and worry and be concerned that you're 24 25 you're not [ __ ] Rich yet because 24 and 25 year olds out there who got a contract for [ __ ] NBA the parents so they won the lottery who knows what there's 24 and 25 year olds out there who are multi-millionaires [ __ ] the hot models these Instagram girls with 3 million followers they're getting [ __ ] by someone and it ain't you and that needs to piss you off you need to get concerned you get worried you [ __ ] I'm running out of time you need to get some urgency in your life put these three things together it's absolutely essential it's the beginning of the Gmod exam when you have these things three things total and done I'll tell you what happens say what happened for me so I became a Sayer so my brothers you see become a Sayer and what that means is I made a pact to him that my word was unbreakable strength and honor and that if I said something I meant it [Music] so when I woke up to my brothers I'm doing a thousand questions so I'm running 20 miles I would do it because if I didn't do it I feel like a [ __ ] because when you instill these mindsets when you're when your mindset changes you start to be extremely accountable for yourself no one's coming to the same thing you've been extremely accountable so when you realize that your words one of the few things you have on this planet if you say things you're going to start sticking here so then it becomes very easy to train you say I'm going to train every day this week I'm gonna train for two hours a day set it it's basically done if I say something it is basically done it's it's set in stone if I say something I'm going to do it there's no way I'm going to say it I'm going to make say some words and speak them into existence in this on this planet and then I'm going to be the kind of [ __ ] who quits because it's too hard and when I say I'm gonna do 10 000 push-ups I'm gonna do it because I'm the kind of person who sticks to the words he says and this is another thing you don't understand it'd be very very specific with what you say because if you can still your mindset correctly and you start to just say things just start saying things then you hold yourself accountable say things you don't even think you want to do wake up and go up to your friend or your mom or whoever and say you know what I'm gonna do a thousand push-ups today say it to people I'm gonna say no you're not so watch me and then you have a choice and you're either gonna succeed like a gene you're gonna be a little [ __ ] you're gonna quit at 310 because it's hard what kind of man are you that's the decision you need to do and you're the kind of man I was I'd say [ __ ] and I'd [ __ ] stick to it my brother said you become a Sayer I used to train with my brother he'd say let's do 500 so let's do 2 000. they'd say well you've said it now so we have to do it exactly set it now so now we have to do it there is no surrendering we have to do it there's another facet who G mind says number four you gotta start saying [ __ ] and your word has to be Iron Unbreakable [Music] foreign I can never be depressed if I never slow down speed is extremely important speed defies gravity how do how does a plane fly through the air and defy gravity speed it's moving too fast to fall if you're always attacking life if you're always doing things if you're always making more money if you're always traveling the world doing this doing that new car here there new podcast me and James English boom boom boom you know if you're always doing things all the time unhappiness can't catch shoots but I also know that speed is a is a fantastic way to be happy all the time I'm always looking forward to something I wake up every day excited I'll go do this today I'll go do this today go do this today and I very much live my life in a frame of not I have to do this it's very much I get to do this we don't live in a real world we are living in a reality where we're told stories and narratives that aren't true where they try very hard to distract us with garbage Rihanna I have nothing against Rihanna like I don't know her but when I see a concert and I see hundreds of thousands of peons standing amongst what are they peons it's the people who go to these concerts means peasant standing because that is an education in language no but but they are peasants because they're acting in a peasant peasant way they're acting like peasants hundreds of thousands of people in a crowd looking up at somebody like their God jumping up and down for hours on end you're a peasant you're a peasant and your life [ __ ] and you have no achievements no money you're depressed but you're distracted I am a feared competitor in anything I do anyone who's up against me at anything is gonna feel a degree of nervousness just because it's me it doesn't matter what it is if you say look you're gonna go learn how to play piano and you're gonna play against someone else who's never played piano and you're gonna learn and that guy's Andrew Tate I can't even play piano but part room's gonna be like ah not tape because even though even though I have no piano experience because they just know me they know my mindset they know my determination they know I'm stubborn they know I don't quit they know I'm they know I'm gonna win that's just who I am so I've constructed a mental model that allows me to be competent and to always succeed and that's how I've come to the conclusions I've come to and I truly once again don't understand how people go through the world without with any other mental model I get asked all the time but what do you feel or what about happiness or depression that doesn't even how I feel doesn't cross my mind I don't know how else explain it there are days where I'm pissed off or sad or happy it doesn't cross my mind and it's just like I woke up whatever mood I happen to be in I have things I need to do it's a busy day zuby's here soon I need to go training before he gets here I had a meeting with the bank at 7 15 a.m I have [ __ ] to do like I didn't cross my mind if I was happy sad excited I just had to work there's very few things in this life we actually have any control over let me tell you the fact the number one facet with G mindset your life is never going to be worse if you walk through the world believing you are the man you wake up and look in the mirror and go on the I'm the man I am the man there's no one on this planet who can do I couldn't do if I put my mind to it there's another thing that a lot of people make a mistake with when I talk to them like ah I have to go to work today change your language I get to go to work today imagine you had no job be worse right because otherwise you wouldn't be working so you get to go to work I have to fix the car at least you have a car you get to fix your car most people don't bought one I have to go get the kids you get to go get the kids because you have these beautiful children who love you you understand people's even their own language is wrong the world is can be framed maybe I'm completely crazy maybe I'm full of [ __ ] like you like you see I am but the frames I've installed in my mind are all beneficial to me so that makes me crazy and full of [ __ ] good because I can't become depressed so you can sit there and tell me I'm full of [ __ ] while you're depressed and I'm happy and I would never want to adopt the thinking of a depressed person they've distracted you with this Idol whoever it happens to be put them there and The Peasants like yeah it's and then they go home and they're told something by the news once again let's make up a completely false scenario be afraid of common cold okay and then anyone who comes back and says why are we afraid of the common cold they delete their point of view they shut them up to create a false reality so people are living a life where they're working a job they're being enslaved by the machines for their tasks but their mind is distracted by garbage and only fed a fake story and they're living inside of a computer generated simulation they're living inside of a world that is not real they don't live in a real world a lot of people live inside of the Matrix completely especially the people who dislike me so I I I think my mental model to a degree I'm certainly not a person who doesn't feel emotions because we're all human I certainly do but I've never prioritized them in any regard I haven't built a mental model that it affects I haven't put them in in the middle of my mental model and that affected my actions based on how I feel for each one it's absolutely and completely the opposite I would love to do a podcast on a day where i'm particularly sad in a podcast on a day where i'm particularly happy and I guarantee you new remote tell the difference so that's what allows me to be competitive right because if you're competitive if you want to be the most competitive predator on the planet you have to be able to hunt in the day in the night you'd be able to do both you're gonna be able to perform when you're happy and sad you can't you can't only be able to perform when you're happy you can't only go to the gym when you're motivated you can't only be a competent person when your life's going well because when your lifestyle going well you're no longer competent then you're going to lose to people like me and it's player versus player if you're the kind of person who can only do well when you're happy and you're competing against someone like me you can do well all the time guess what you lose so my mental model the answer is most of my opinions are just based around constructing a mental model that allows me to be brutally competitive it's why I say depression isn't real I've argued this point endlessly and I try and explain to people but they're not smart enough to understand that I I care if I'm wrong and I don't care I get it I am more competitive as an individual if I don't believe I can become depressed so I don't give a [ __ ] if I'm right or wrong because no matter what bad happens to me in my life even if the heaven forbid the worst things on earth that could happen happen to me I could never become clinically depressed because I would never self-diagnose myself as clinically depressed because I don't believe in it I believe I am currently sad but I have work to do and eventually I will feel better people will people will shield laziness with anything no one wants to admit they're lazy the so they'll Shield it with disbelief Ah that's a scam or I don't work hard I work smart bollocks more more cover for just anything it takes to say I don't want to work do you believe in that works more or not harder I believe in both yeah but there's a time when it comes to work smart and most people are trying to do the SMART work before they do the hard work it's kind of like Talent right you don't notice if you're talented at something till all the hard work's done yeah I could be the most talented tennis player in the world but I don't play tennis so why go down the tennis court Joe Schmo is going to smoke me I don't get to see my talent until I've worked so hard that I'm in the top one percent and now I'm beating them because I have some god-given gift yeah you understand you have to do the hard work first if there's no hard work there's no smart work so someone's gonna sit there and go I work smart I don't work hard so I only have to work an hour a day if working smart gets you a lot done in an hour a day then you should work smart for 12 hours a day and get 12 times the work done I will never get to a point of absolute desperation and kill myself because I don't I'll never even hopelessness because I don't believe in the idea of hopelessness you cannot try and make me adult thinking that will reduce my competitiveness as an individual so I don't know if I'm wrong I don't believe in it that's it end of the story so I don't believe in things that take power away from me I don't believe in things that make me less competitive and I don't adult mental models that may be less competitive every single Bento model I have are the most efficient ones I could find they're the mental model I found that if I adopt I become a more fearsome Predator that's it so this is how I've come to all of my conclusions as an individual if you take a man and give him a life shielded from problems that he never has any to face I guarantee you he's terrible at being a man the best men in the world have gone through [ __ ] that's why women love scars because it didn't kill you that's the whole point of it right so the best thing you can do as a man is look and go okay this is hard this is hard this is hard this is hard I feel negative because these are all so difficult I'm struggling with XYZ let me internalize all of that and turn it into a superpower let me become genuinely uncomfortable with my situation in life and go and fix things because like I said the universe is absolutely and utterly very giving and if you truly hated being in a position you were in you wouldn't be there very long every time I feel stressed or under pressure I get excited I I hate to not be stressed I wake up and I'm like everything's good yes like that's just how I am right it's how you look at the problems and how you use them to fuel you so the question was what's the problem for the average man today what's the biggest problem I think there's a whole host of problems but what you have to do is frame it inside of your mind and understand that all of those problems are going to allow you give you the fuel the unlimited motivation that you need become a successful and and beautiful individual if you frame it in the right way biggest problem that men face isn't the problems themselves it's just a way they've been taught to mentally frame issues people think when bad things happen to them that somehow they're a victim to the universe and bad things only happen to me and this is so terrible they don't understand that bad things happen to everybody and the most successful person you know had all those maybe even worse at least the same bad things happen to them they just framed it differently and used it that's that's the difference so I I don't pray for an easy life I pray for a life of difficulty that allows me to become a better and better person I I pray to become more competent to handle problems I pray to put myself in a position where if the mass media machine attempts its very best to destroy my life I can laugh and smile from my villain Dubai this is who I pray to become I don't pray that nobody hurts me I pray to be able to fight so it's a different mentality I think a lot of people build their mindsets around trying to feel good people who want to ignore the idea of personal responsibility or self-accountability because they feel better if they pretend it's not a real thing they feel that better if they pretend everything's someone else's fault a lot of people's mental model and how they view the world is based around them feeling as good as possible so people are basing their mindsets around trying to feel good I have always tried to base my mindset around absolute competence regardless of how I feel and there are there are certainly disadvantages to that there are times you're going to be a lot more pessimistic or you're going to be a lot more stressed or a lot more you know pissed off about certain things than others yeah that can be seen as a downside but like I said I use all of those things for unlimited motivation to propel My Endless upward trajectory but if you construct a mindset that allows you to be as competent as possible as opposed to feel any different or feel better then you're going to naturally come to the conclusions I've come to you're as competent as possible if you believe you can affect absolutely everything about your life you're as competent as possible if you believe absolutely everything that's happened to you whether good or bad is completely your fault you're as competent as possible if you believe the bad things that happen to you are going to allow you to work harder and become even better when bad things happen to me the first thing on my mouth is good good Andrew this they took 10 million dollars at the bank because they canceled you good good that's just my response good Andrew this happened good good good now now I'm really pissed that this mindset I've constructed allows me to be as fearsome a competitor as possible it allows me to be a feared opponent in any realm of human endeavor and that's that's the point of a mindset why would you have a mental model or a mentality that made you anything less in the ultra competitive world that we've just discussed discussing that everybody wants the things you have why would you absorb information or construct a mental model that doesn't allow you to be as competitive as possible I am a competitor in anything I do anyone who's up against me at anything is going to feel a degree of nervousness just because it's hot it doesn't matter what it is if you say look you're gonna go learn how to play piano and you're gonna play against someone else who's never played piano and you're gonna learn and that guy's Andrew Tate you're anybody I can't even play piano but part room's gonna be like ah an update even though even though I have no piano experience because they just know me they know my mindset they know my determination they know I'm stubborn they know I don't quit they know I'm they know I'm gonna win that's just who I am so I've constructed a mental model that allows me to be competent and to always succeed and that's how I've come to the conclusions I've come to and I truly once again don't understand how people go through the world without with any other mental mode I get asked all the time but what do you feel or what about happiness or depression that that doesn't even how I feel doesn't cross my mind I don't

so I I I think my mental model to a degree I'm certainly not a person who doesn't feel emotions because we're all human I certainly do but I've never prayer prioritize them in any regard I haven't built a mental model that it affects I haven't put them in in the middle of my mental model and that affected my actions based on how I feel for each one is absolutely and completely the opposite I would love to do a podcast on a day where i'm particularly sad in a podcast on a day when I'm particularly happy and I guarantee you new emails tell the difference so that's what allows me to be competitive right because if you're competitive if you want to be the most competitive predator on the planet you have to be able to hunt in the day in the night you need to be able to do both you have to be able to perform when you're happy and sad you can't you can't only be able to perform when you're happy you can't only go to the gym when you're motivated you can't only be a competent

just based around constructing a mental model that allows me to be brutally competitive it's why I say depression isn't real I've argued this point endlessly and I try and explain to people but they're not smart enough to understand that I don't care if I'm wrong I'm more competitive Joel if I so I don't give a [ __ ] if I'm right or wrong because no matter what bad happens to me in my life even the heaven forbid the worst things on earth that could happen happen to me I could never become clinically depressed because I would never self-diagnose myself as clinically depressed because I don't believe in it I believe I am currently sad but I have work to do and eventually I will feel better I will never get to a point of absolute desperation and kill myself because I don't I'll never get to a point of helplessness because I don't believe in the idea of the ideas you cannot try and make me adopt thinking that will reduce my competitiveness as an individual if I'm wrong I don't believe in it that's it end of story so I don't believe in things that take power away from me I don't believe in things that may be less competitive and I don't adopt mental models that may be less competitive every single mental model I have are the most efficient ones I could find they're the mental model I found that if I adopt I become a more fearsome Predator that's it so this is how I've come to all of my conclusions as an individual foreign if the ocean doesn't reach a point of equal and opposite force it will just engulf the entire planet right there has to be an equal and opposite Force at some point I'm not talking about freeing every single person from The Matrix I'm talking about freeing enough people who are ready to understand how the world really works so that there is an equal and opposite Force to the terrain of [ __ ] the absolute clown world [ __ ] they're trying to push on all of us if nobody stands up to it we're gonna end up just swallowing it all yeah it's garbage so you need to have an equal uh Army on the other side money is certainly related to power but the true power of the world is influence I am currently one of the most powerful people on the planet I can influence millions and millions and millions of young people with my mouth Alone by speaking that's why they fear me and every single thing that's happening in the world today whether it's a pitched battle all of it is done with the goal of exerting influence on your mind they're trying to control what you think they're trying to control why you think it why you believe it they're trying to convince you that they haven't even put propaganda into your mind and is all a battle for influence that's all this has ever been most people are not smart enough most people are not intelligent enough to self-analyze and defrag their own brains and understand their being programmed you didn't like me for example I don't like Andrew Tate why well they told me not to like him who told me well these people do they care about me no most people don't get an opinion and break down where it even comes from they just get an opinion and they they just they defend it and you'll see people arguing and fighting in the street over opinions they don't even know where they've come from in the first place most people are not intelligent enough for that so everybody and everything you consume is going to influence you to a degree the mass media machines trying to influence everyone I'm trying to influence everyone I'm right here trying to influence people I'll sit here and say I'm trying to influence people at home I did not say that girls above a certain age are horrible people I did not say girls love in a certain age are useless I said girls above a certain age are less attractive than girls who are younger because of Innocence I'm talking about the Western World and in the western world there's no girl at age I don't know 32 in Las Vegas who is pure not a single one on the planet so we can't sit here and apply what I'm talking about for the Western World to the Middle Eastern world I'm under attack every single day they're attacking my character they're attacking my Integrity they're attacking my finances they're attacking my freedom they're attacking my companies every single day I wake up and there are people on the planet whose goal is to attempt to destroy me so I am under attacks I was kind of up and down I was working in the fish market but I was still fighting at the same time I was training themselves pretty young started to make a little bit of money fighting but not much and then I I had different jobs I sold television advertising and worked for an advertising company Etc and I had my own business for a while trying to sell TV advertising and I had a bunch of sales jobs back and forth worked for car sales I I'd always been doing this and that going from place to place um unless it was a sales job I never really took it that seriously because it was the unlimited commission that I found attractive but outside of sales jobs I just did my very best to I did a whole bunch of things it's been an Eclectic long interesting Journey so I grew up with a bunch of uh very close Muslim friends and I've always been not envious but certainly I've had a large amount of adoration for their respect for their families respect for their culture their Brotherhood the way they operate I've always thought it's a fantastic way to be God knows the truth of our heart so I know that my my reversion is sincere I understand that because I'm in the public eye there's going to be some degree of people who question it but I know that mine's completely sincere and the people who do it in a non-sincere way God knows the truth and uh they're not going to be able to fool him so good luck and someone else said to me they said that it's important that someone like you that has all of the worldly Treasures or everything that you could possibly ever wish for in this world still understands the importance of believing in God I have a very small circle but every single one of my friends has a utility like we're all very capable individuals we're all doing very important things we all help each other and Aid each other in different ways I don't have any friends just to sit around and talk [ __ ] and do nothing I guess in many ways people would say oh well Andrew you have family and business partners but I consider them my my friends we have a very small network of five maybe six people and yeah they're my friends I'm not the kind of person who can fall victim to some random stroking by eagle ego and I'm not a dummy like me I know a lot of people get rich in their dummies that's not me I don't have any new friends I have the same Circle I've always had in fact it's getting smaller by the way it gets smaller not bigger I don't have these random friends I party with none of this kind of crap I provide value by default by being me that's who I am you're going to be my friend you need to provide some value to my life now a lot of people may have friends the value that's provided by their friend is that their friend makes them laugh or that their friend is funny well I don't need that crap I'm busy right so I need someone who's actually useful to me a real thing it's not a shallow way to look at it because people say that shallow not at all I think that in true friendship and true relationships whether it's man woman or man man or woman woman there needs to be an exchange of value people need to both gain and receive value and that's how you build true friendships so you need to become useful to me and the problem with doing that is I already have extremely useful people around me we can already do everything I don't need anybody so when someone comes and goes hey I'd love to know you that why what what what do you want to do sit around talk [ __ ] like what do you want to do like I'm trying to do XYZ I'm fighting The Matrix can you fight the Matrix can you fight they can't do anything I don't want to I don't want to hang around there's a time when it comes to work smart and most people are trying to do the SMART work before they do the hard work it's kind of like Talent you don't notice if you're talented at something until all the hard work's done I could be the most talented tennis player in the world but I don't play tennis so if I go down the tennis court Joe schmoe is going to smoke me I don't get to see my talent until I've worked so hard that I'm in the top one percent and now I'm beating them because I have some god-given gift we have to do the hard work first if there's no hard work there's no smart work so someone's gonna sit there and go I work smart I don't work hard so I only have to work an hour a day if working smart gets you a lot done in an hour a day then you should work smart for 12 hours a day and get 12 times the work done I I am absolutely not really a believer in hard work I'm a proponent of hard work I have all this money and all I do is work my entire life is work this podcast is work I'm getting the car and go to another meeting work it's all work my entire life is work and people don't want to look at life that way they want to talk about work life balance and being lazy and all this crap I don't believe in any of that I believe in if you want to win you have to out compete the man who's prepared to do nothing but work is player versus player if you're gonna sit there and go I don't want to work more than hour a day well the guy who does want to work more an hour a day is going to beat you and no matter how smart you are there's always a smart dude who's doing the same smart work you are for more hours than you're doing it that's just the nature of the game and this is why we talk about things like passive income passive incomes a scam I'm tired of people coming to me saying I want to make passive income and I sit there and say it's not about it being a scam it's about the mentality towards this game look everyone loves passive money right I make money as I sleep I get it you need to delink your time to your money because if you're only working for money you run out of time you can't make enough money I understand all those principles my point is if you have no money and you're coming to me saying I want to make passive income why are you not making active income get up off your ass and work first because there's no such thing as completely truly a hundred percent passive you're gonna have to check on it you have to maintain it but the idea that people with no money are already so concerned with making money without work is amazing to me you should be worried about active income if you show me if I'm broken and you show me how to make a thousand dollars an hour I don't sit there and go okay but how can I make that passive I go cool I'm making eighteen thousand dollars a day because I'm gonna work you don't need to worry about passive income until you have no more time I look at passive income because I have 18 hours a day I work when all 18 of those hours are done and my workload still isn't finished I have to find a way to make some of those income streams passive either via staff or whatever else and that's how I work smart I use all of my time and when all my time is done now I have to become more efficient so that I can get more done within the same time frame to sit there and say I don't want to use my time so I want passive income he's dumb ass it's dumb [ __ ] the 16 year old making 45 Grand a month if he was to sit to me and go I don't want to make the tick tock so I want someone else to do it make it passive that he wouldn't make any money he's just working you have to just work some point you have to bite the bullet and just work so when someone comes to me talk about passive income and they're broken I'm like you are just lazy lazy people never get anywhere in life doesn't matter what it is no matter the tennis or money if you're lazy you're never gonna get a lot of people with no money are are really really arrogant I know a lot of broke people who are very arrogant people will shield laziness with anything no one wants to admit they're lazy so they'll Shield it with disbelief Ah that's a scam or I don't work hard I work smart bollocks more more cover how to be successful as a man we'll talk about it first thing you need freedom because you ain't a man if you're not free and you may sit there I'm not a slave I get paid really well listen the slaves got free food and Free Shelter in exchange for work now all they've done is got rid of the food and sheltered give you dollars which you spend on food and shelter and you basically have nothing left you're still fall asleep the first thing you need is freedom if you're not free you're not a man first we're not a successful man so you should always be working towards freedom and I mean Freedom with your time do what you want Freedom with your location go where you want there's a riot cool go in Tokyo see you later bye going to Australia see you later bye Freedom one thing the next thing that constitutes success is a man is your network who are you talking to who are these people who will answer your phone calls listen how about two phones identical almost twins I got two phones right here and I can call one of many multi-millionaires and when they see my name they're gonna pick up the phone they're like oh [ __ ] tape oh wait guys wait wait they're gonna stop their conversation and be like whoa [ __ ] tables what's up Tate because they know I don't call for no [ __ ] they'll be like [ __ ] money money money phone free so I can call multi-millionaires right now I can have the best idea in the world I can call a bunch of multi-millionaires right now say look I need 100 million here's my idea we can make something happen you can't do that I can do that Freedom Network and then you get into the Aesthetics of life for people to view you as successfully you need good body language you need physical presence a man who's not dangerous a man who has no physicality it will never be seen as successful oh I'm successful I'm rich and although the yeah I'll I'll break your neck look how big my hand is I'm gonna grab you by your neck and choke you till you die you're successful now I'm breathing and you're not so I'm more successful than you you can't be a little bit and I understood this from a young age as well so I'm sitting there at a young age thinking I need to get a network of high net worth individuals who are not even rich men but men who are driven men who are making money and I need to find a way to talk to them work for them learn what they know so I can become one of them I need to get body language and physicality I need to become big and dangerous I need to be able to display that without saying I need women in love with me I need beautiful women who adore me I need these things because this is what shows the world I'm the [ __ ] dog so I'm sitting there and I understand what I need and I knew this at 21 22. a lot of you people are older than this older you're older than I was and I'm telling you something you said you're going yeah didn't even cross your [ __ ] mind you've been too busy jerking off the porno and all thinking about what you actually need to do to be successful in this life so these are the things you need to be a high value man if you have all those things and then you get some money and you have geographical and time Freedom you're now genuinely successful your mentality is heavily linked to your reality and the fact that most people have such weak mindsets comes from the fact that they have a weak life a weak body a weak Social Circle a weak Network a weak bank account a weak relationship and then their mind is weak well of course whereas if you had a group of soldiers around you men who were dedicated who would ride or die with you if you were strong if your woman would never leave you no matter what because she idolizes you then your mentality would be strong your mind would be strong by extension so if someone comes to me and goes I doubt myself I usually look at them and go yeah I understand why you're a little fat piece you're stupid of course you do hey Andrew um so how do I get like a six-pack quick what's the best fastest way to get a six-pack why does it have to be quick why does it have to be easy why do you think life is all quick and easy why can't it be hard and difficult why can't you suffer because suffering is what gives it value if everyone had a six-pack and it was quick and easy then it wouldn't be valuable would it if everyone walked around with a quick six-pack and they got it easily the no one would give a [ __ ] the whole point is that's difficult value is linked to difficulty if you want something that is valuable you need something which is difficult to obtain the fact that you just said you wanted it quick and easily shows that your whole mental model is you shouldn't be thinking about quick and easy you should be thinking about hard suffering pain going through it that's what you should be thinking about this is going to be hard but I'm going to do it anyway because when it is done then everyone's going to know that I went through something difficult why do you want it to be quick and easy success is the most overused word because we talk about success well this guy is he's really successful so let's say I'm working that company yeah I'm the big boss let's say I'm a guy I go College I go University I go to this company I work I work I work I become a manager I'm on 150 000 a year I got a company BMW and I wear a suit and everyone at my job does as I say by all measures I'm a successor but here's the truth when I leave that company no one gives a [ __ ] about me I'm a nobody outside of that one building where I'm a little bit important my wife doesn't want to suck my dick because I'm fat because I didn't have time to train so all I did was work I got a BMW BMW I know hoes with BMWs BMW I didn't even consider that car BMW that's not a luxury car that's [ __ ] basic I'm pushing super cars you're a nobody you're not successful for [ __ ] success for a man actually comes in many Realms it's not it's actually nothing to do with being good at your job having money yeah you don't have to be good at your job depression is the ultimate motivation oh so you're depressed okay that so you come along to me and you tell me you're depressed I expect to see a huge list of what you're achieving per day if you're unhappy with your life and you're depressed I don't expect you to be popping pills and sitting laying in bed I expect you to give me a huge list of everything you're achieving per day depression is a fantastic motivation you know but people are told the opposite no you feel the process wrong you should be happy anyway take the pills stay home take some time off complete garbage you're depressed okay get up go for a run lift more weights make more money just get a second job get more girls like you you can outrun depression I'm a man who's always believed and I think every man understands this action over in action and and I think it was General Patton who said a good plan today is better than a perfect plan tomorrow you go do something and you gotta do something fast yeah you're just sitting around talking about it and hoping for things to get better has never I don't know I don't know about you gentlemen but every time I run out of money in my bank and I thought I'm gonna sit around and hope for something to come it never really worked out it never worked out you know it's like you can't be sitting around waiting for things to happen to you also I think especially in the west a lot of people's problems are all in their mind and I'm not saying that mental conditions aren't real because absolutely some are but I try and explain to people look if you the only thing on the planet you have genuine control over is your state of mind like you can't even control your health you might get hit by lightning you can't control other people you can't control the weather you can't control anything the only thing you can affect in genuine real time is how you feel in your head if someone comes to me and goes ah I get really shy and anxious I'll say so right not not oh okay that must be horrible not so do anyway yeah but I'm shot I don't care I don't no one cares the whole world doesn't care nobody cares drop dead tomorrow the world wouldn't care the sun's still going to rise people's still gonna go to work so you're gonna sit here and worry about speaking when people come to me and say I'm not happy I say why should you be happy and and we're all adults here the this infantile mindset that we're all supposed to be like we were when we were three years old and oh something shiny laugh all the time run around in circles we're grown-ups and we have responsibilities and we have problems and we have pressure and you don't necessarily have to be happy to perform especially if you're a man like like women have this uh I I will I guess to a degree they're born lucky women have this mindset where they can people expect women to be happy women need to be happy but as a man you have a burden of performance you as a man you shouldn't be waking up going how do I get happy there are four main ways paying money you either trade your time for money you trade information for money you give a product or service for money or you put something to work for money I'll say that again we're gonna go through them one by one these are the main ways that money will arise in your bank account remember what I just told you guys the four main things about cash how it works How You Gonna attack it identify Works movies Etc these are the four main ways money is made first is time for money now this is what most jobs are and there's nothing wrong with the job a lot of people are going to come and say quit your job no there's nothing wrong with having a job and it's better than doing nothing but this is the first level this is the first level on how to make money so what you do when you have a job is you give up your time to get some cash so a guy will say if you stand here all day I'll give you x amount of money and you agree you give up your time to make money the problem with giving up your time to make money is what who knows the problem of giving up your time to make money I'll tell you the problem the problem is you only have a certain amount of time it's very difficult to get rich if you give up your time for money because you have a certain amount of time you need to sleep you need to eat you got other stuff to do you haven't got the time to sit there and get rich that way so time for money is great and obviously the more valuable your time is the better that's fine you can make more but you still have a finite amount of time and this is the problem with trading your time for money next is information for money now the good thing about getting information from us is that your time is not explicitly linked so if you do something like a video giving information that one video you can film at one time but it can be given out or sold a million times and you get paid every single time but your time is no longer linked to the money so a lot of people make money purely on information and this it could be done lots of ways it can be done with what I'm doing right now I'm making money based on what I know right now I am selling information excuse me I know information and I'm provided there are also high level Consultants do the same thing information is valuable we live in the age of information another thing I want you to write down your notes some of the two most important things in the world today are information and attention if you can get if you have information and you can get attention you will be rich because if you can get attention people are going to pay attention to you and if you have information to give them you're going to be rich this webinar is an example of how me a person who can attract attention who has information can make money so information for money is better than time for money now every single person sitting here there must be something you know you know something you know something others don't know it doesn't matter if it's how to play guitar doesn't matter is how to play piano it doesn't matter if it's how to fix a car doesn't matter what it is you must have some information that other people find useful that information can be weaponized and it can be turned into money we're going to get into how to do that later but it's not actually very complicated you need to Garner attention you need to produce uh the videos or the subject material or the the PDFs or whatever you want to do explain to people what you know you need to establish credibility so they understand that they can trust you and they will pay for your information this is another way to get money information so keep that in mind write that down because when you write down your piece of paper information you also need to sit and think what do I know that other people don't know so there must be something you know and that information is valuable you have to convince people it's valuable and to come and buy it from you next this is what most businesses do they provide a product or a service for money now this is different from information because even though if you provide a service you have information let's say you fix car you know how to fix cars you have that information but you're not selling the information you're selling the service which is different the information would be selling me a book on how to fix my own car the service is coming here in deficient form so a product or service selling for money this is very very simple that's what most businesses do they buy they get a product store service and they sell it for a markup now this is actually this is the way that most Mega businesses make money but in the modern world it's quite difficult to do and it's difficult to do because most products and services are monopolized they're monopolized because everyone's already selling everything and we live in a global economy now and there's no product you can think of that I can't go to amazon.com and find cheaper from China and they'll sell it at a one penny maybe two Penny markup so the product route is getting harder unless you're very very unique and you build a brand which is I'm going to get into the service is fine but you know what the problem with service is service is once again linked to your time if you're providing a service you're still giving up your time for money do you understand so the product angle is difficult the service angle is difficult the time angle is difficult so far the only angle we have will allow you to make money scalable out and Beyond is information for money next putting something else to do the work for you now this is what corporations and the mega rich people do they either get people to work for them or they get their money to work for them so to keep their time free they make other people or other things give up their time so a company will come along let's look at the slides a company will come along with a service it will advertise its service it will then hire people number one so we'll get people to work for them and then those people will give up their time in exchange for a wage give up their time for a wage and the company will keep money so the owner of that company although he has to manage things his time is not explicitly linked to income now the super wealthy with the super wealthy people do is they get their money to work for them and if your money works for you it's even better than people because people need to be managed a lot more than money your money doesn't need to be managed money just works so if you have millions of dollars and you put them in a ten percent you can get a 10 return or even a three percent return you're going to be rich on the interest without doing anything so making your money making money is great but you could only live off this money if you already have a lot of money so let's go back through and analyze getting people to work for you is complicated setup because you actually need to sell a product or service to get most people to work also you need to people manage so for a long mere period of time you're not going to have your time free this is the first thing second thing getting your money to work for you you need a lot of money to live off the work your money does you need a lot of money to get this to happen most people don't have enough money to put their money to work to live on it now you still should put your money to work I want to talk about that so you can't live off your money work I can never be depressed if I never slow down speed is extremely important speed defies gravity how do how does a plane fly through the air and defide gravity speed it's moving too fast to fall if you're always attacking life if you're always doing things if you're always making more money if you're always traveling the world doing this doing that new car here there new podcast me and James English boom boom boom you know if you're always doing things all the time unhappiness can't catch you but I also know that speed is a is a fantastic way to be happy all the time I'm always looking forward I'm always looking forward to something I wake up every day excited I'll go do this today I'll go do this today I'm gonna do this today and I very much live my life in a frame of not I have to do this it's very much I get to do this there's another thing that a lot of people make a mistake with when I talk to them like ah I have to go to work today change your language I get to go to work today imagine you had no job be worse right because otherwise you wouldn't be working so you get to go to work oh I have to fix the car at least you have a car you get to fix your car most people don't bought one I have to go get the kids you get to go get the kids because you have these beautiful children who love you you understand people's even their own language is wrong the world is can be framed maybe I'm completely crazy maybe I'm full of [ __ ] like you like you said maybe I am but the frames I've installed in my mind are all beneficial to me so that makes me crazy and full of [ __ ] good because I can't become depressed so you can sit there and tell me I'm full of [ __ ] while you're depressed and I'm happy and I would never want to adopt the thinking of a depressed person people will people will shield laziness with anything no one wants to admit they're lazy so they'll Shield it with disbelief Ah that's a scam or I don't work hard I work smart ball looks more more cover for just anything it takes to say I don't want to work do you believe in that works more or not harder I believe in both yeah but there's a time when it comes to work smart and most people are trying to do the SMART work before they do the hard work it's kind of like Talent right you don't notice if you're talented at something until all the hard work's done yeah I could be the most talented tennis player in the world but I don't play tennis so if I go down the tennis court Joe Schmo is going to smoke me I don't get to see my talent until I've worked so hard that I'm in the top one percent and now I'm beating them because I have some god-given gift yeah you understand you have to do the hard work first if there's no hard work there's no smart work so someone's gonna sit there and go I work smart I don't work hard so I only have to work an hour a day if working smart gets you a lot done in an hour a day then you should work smart for 12 hours a day and get 12 times the work done I I am absolutely not really a believer in hard work I'm a proponent of hard work I have all this money and all I do is work my entire life is work this podcast is work I'm getting the car I'm going to another meeting work I want to go to the gym so I'm in good shape work it's all work my entire life is work and people don't want to look at life that way they want to talk about work life balance and being lazy and all this crap I don't believe in any of that I believe in if you want to win you have to out-compete the man who's prepared to do nothing but work is player versus player if you're gonna sit there and go I don't want to work more than an hour a day well the guy who does want to work more an hour a day is going to beat you and no matter how smart you are there's always a smart dude who's doing the same smart work you are for more hours than you're doing it that's just the nature of the games the way that humans work and the way that we are we've evolved as a species is that we don't really learn lessons unless they're learned the hard way yeah I believe that unless a lesson has taught the hard way you're not going to learn it you can have so many near-misses and people won't learn their lesson bro you must know a guy who goes out there nearly crashes his car nearly crashes his car nearly crashes this car doesn't slow his ass down to wrecks it yeah but this is how people are right so you need that pain for the lesson to sting enough to really genuinely go inside of your mind and it's the same with everything it's the same with driving a car or business truthfully if you want to learn a lesson about business you're gonna have to suffer at some point right so we always say that most people are not successful with their first companies XYZ blah blah blah I get that the truth is there's a lot of people who make a lot of money with their first company but they just spunk it act an idiot and it all blows up in their face and that's all and that's how you get the discipline on your fourth company that when you have three million in the bank you just leave it there you know it's and don't and don't be done with it so you need to you need to go through some pain you need to experience some negative things you need to have to uh to a degree some trauma to really even learn any lessons so yeah business studies you're right the book that's that's not going to teach you anything about business you need to get out there on the streets you need to you need to make mistakes you need to suffer you need to have the tax man knocking at your door you're gonna deal with all that stuff so that you make sure it doesn't happen again I really think that humans are stupid enough to only learn the hard way and and life really doesn't have to be that complicated when you see somebody that has something you want you just got to try and work out how they got it yeah and that's the missing part most people see people with things they want and they don't do the second half they don't try and work out how they got that thing oh my man is a Ferrari okay I wish I had a Ferrari okay they don't sit there and go for an hour how did you get Ferrari it doesn't cross that that part is the part they don't want to do right they just go oh he's a Ferrari wish I had a Ferrari and then go back to TV yeah and that's why they lose it's player versus player out here man it's on the street it's not easy for every dollar you make for every pound you take you took it from someone else you don't make money you take money people don't understand the way that money Works you're not the Federal Reserve you can't create money from thin air every single pound in your bank is money you took from someone else when I say take I don't mean it in a negative way you might have convinced them to give it to you you might have a coffee shop I'll give you a nice coffee you'll give me some money cool but you still took his money yeah right so if you're out here trying to take stuff from other people don't you want to have a team you'll do it by yourself you'll be Rambo if you get two of you doing it you got two of you that's right so the whole idea of this lone soldier this Rambo I'll do all by myself that's all dead bro you need to have a team it's player versus player and for the same reason if you're out here on the street and you want to defend yourself you want your boys around you it's the same thing with trying to get rich like you're laughing with your boys the broken things are great and I'm not complaining about being rich all this how I worked hard for this and it's a fantastic life I live now but I think without those Brokey days without those original days to compare it to without that juxtaposition that I don't think being rich would be fun at all I think it's only fun because you can compare it to the days when you weren't Rich that's the only thing that makes it fun the only thing that makes about ten thousand dollar steak fun is that you can laugh saying how you never had 10 grand in your bank until you were 27 years old yeah like that's otherwise it's boring otherwise okay steak and I think if you're born with too much money that you'll never truly be happy I think you need the broken days or the best days [Music] [Music]
