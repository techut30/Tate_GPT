we have to discuss quickly nikolai tesla said something very interesting and it was if you want to understand the secrets of the universe you must think in terms of frequency vibration and energy and i for the last couple years have been paying very close attention to energy exchanges and how energy is generated between people i walk into a club even if i don't do anything i just walk in everybody notices man woman staff everyone pays attention they are now aware that i have arrived most people are involved in low energy activities so let's look at the rihanna thing we were just talking about if you're rihanna on stage and all these people are screaming at you they got much energy and attention and i'm talking energy in terms of genuine measures of energy like kilojolts of energy that can like heat up a cup of coffee genuine energy is coming her way and she's absorbing it all and you wonder why this [ __ ] is all these celebrities look good when they're old and why they're happy all the time now pseudoscience whatever but they're absorbing energy and attention from people and they seem to defy age and they're happy whereas the people in the crowd are giving all their energy away what are they getting back a recording of a song they could listen to on youtube and then they go home and they're depressed well i really love that counselor but i'm having to come down now and i'm just sad and i can't wait for the next one and one of the secrets in the universe is learning how to absorb the energy from other people and use it against them some people are energy takers others are energy givers there are producers in the world and there are consumers and what's actually interesting is if you talk about content being a producer is better than being a consumer if you talk about energy be a consumer is better than being a producer
