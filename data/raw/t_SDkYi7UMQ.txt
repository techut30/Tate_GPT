I always knew the answer to everything is raw action the answer to everything has always been raw action my dad had a tweet about this he said that raw action solves all and he used to say this I give you an example if you're a farmer and you need rain for your crop and there's no rain you can sit there and say there's no rain we're all going to starve or you can stand up and do a rain dance now will your rain dance work perhaps not perhaps the rain won't come but I would argue that you're better off standing up doing that rain dance than just sitting there waiting to die you have to do something raw action solves so when I was broke I was never like ah I'm poor I'm poor what do I do it was I'm poor what must I have to do something I just if I was broke I'd go for a run that's why I was such a great fighter if I was broke I'd sit there and go I'm actually poor how do I make money don't know how can I make where can I get some cash don't know what work can I do don't know I'll just go for a run then and I just go for three mile run you just have to say well I have to do something I can't just sit still and die a lot of people are happy to just sit still and die or can go to sleep and take a nap well if that's what you want to do then you could say a loser that's fine I'm glad there are losers because if everyone had Lamborghinis my Lamborghini wouldn't be fun to show off I need you to look at it and feel the Deep pain in your heart of regret and failure that's the whole point of it I need to drive my Bugatti and everyone be looking at it going I'll never have one of those I can get all their energy and feel it all and it makes me happy fantastic so you can stay at home and do nothing but when I was poor I had to go for a run I couldn't sit still or lift weights or do something I couldn't even sleep so raw action solves everything and I understood that as at a young age but as you get older you get to look back and you get to put your whole story together the whole tapestry together I knew I wouldn't stay poor did I ever think I'd get this Rich well I never said I wouldn't but did I ever think it would probably happen at this level no but it's amazing how the compounding interest of just endless raw action adds up I've never had a lazy day I've never skipped work never missed an email never never had a day off ever ever you name the you would go through the last three years of my life you will see that there's never been a day where I wasn't doing what I was supposed to do and it all just adds up and then Monumental success comes and you get to laugh at everybody else hahaa and and life's great well I think that initially fighting is always the best thing you can ever do especially it's the best way to spend your 20s because you heal super humanly you heal like Wolverine and I can't think of a better use of that superhuman healing ability besides fighting and it's going to teach you everything you need to know about personal accountability and hard work and overcoming fear and dedication and discipline there's so many lessons to be found inide of fighting and plus it's the most respect sport on the planet and I think that you'll learn more about yourself and more about life and more about the realities of how the world works if you're a fighter so I think that's what's so fantastic about it all of my wisdom and all the things I say doesn't come from books it comes from life experience and a lot of my life experiences the brutal realities of violence so people say oh Andrew's so smart Andrew's so wise Andrew knows so many things I've learned all of that simply through fighting and if you're a warrior in life the arena may change but the battle never end it's just never ending and you have to get used to fighting you have to get used to being under pressure and under stress all the time and being the kind of person who could perform and smile anyway and I'm glad I spent my 20's training cuz I can't think of something else I find it amazing that like I speak to people my age and I say in my 20s I spent maybe I don't know let's say three hours a day what's a decade of three hours a day let's say 10,000 hours I spent 10,000 hours in the gym training you're the same age as me what did you do with those 10,000 hours they can't even tell me what they did what did you do watch TV go out go Pub sit around sleep na chase women what did you actually do we had the same amount of waking hours and the same amount of minutes I know where 10,000 hours of my minutes went and that's why I'm the champ that's why I have four title belts above my bed that's how I spent my 10,000 hours tell me what you did with your 10,000 hours which is equal to comparable to or Superior than how I spent my time and they can't even name what they did with any of their time they're like don't no so if you're 16 you need to be using every single waking minute towards things you're going to remember you're going to remember training you're going to remember working hard you're going to remember trying to make money you're doing your spending your life and wasting your time doing things you're not even going to be able to recollect in a few years you're going to wonder why you fall behind the people who don't waste time time is the ultimate currency time is money time is also strength and power and networks connection time is everything you convert it it's like malleable time is like Playdoh yeah you can turn it into anything you can turn it into muscles if you go to the gym turn it into fighting prowess if you go to the fight gym but people have all this time and they just mush around with it and then they're like oh I don't know why don't know why I'm failing I wish I was successful when you're living that type of life and you end up searching for meaning you end up down the path of Hedonism because the meaning is I want to have as much fun as possible but fun in of itself I was talking to another another girl and I was saying to her that fun she was saying to me you know what Andrew all you do is work you never really have fun and I said fun is Haram he goes is fun really Haram I'm like no it's not but please understand what I'm trying to say here what I'm trying to say is when you look at what most people do for fun it's look with fun is clubs drinking running around laughing like a kid all this you all all the bad things in life the negative harames can be obained through this obsession with fun if you find a man who's obsessed with work I have things I need to do and I feel satisfied inside when I do them I have duty and I have work and I have obligations to fill and objectives to meet I feel happy when they are done that is my fun my fun is clearing my emails making $2 million in the day buying another investment property I don't need going to bed training hard eating right that's my fun call me boring that's what I enjoy when you were talking about that lifestyle and what you end up searching for in that Hedonism you just end up searching for excesses right to have more fun you want to get more drun go to more clubs or and it's just a black hole it never ends and you end up destroying yourself we need discipline we need purpose we need to have parameters set for us and and truthfully as a person you're happier that way that's why I quit drinking people think I quit drinking because cuz I reverted to Islam that's not why I actually quit drinking 2 months before that I was extremely effective on alcohol I was I I would drink four or five times a week because I'm extremely rich and I have a very good life and I'm in my mansion and I'm drinking I was still world famous I was still making millions of dollars I was still in fantastic physical condition all the videos you watched me from a year and a half ago I still look like a bodybuilder I still outperformed everybody I didn't have a drink problem I could easily quit in fact I didn't even want to drink most of the time it's just a party going on I was still monumentally successful on alcohol and I could continue to drink alcohol for the rest of my life but I stopped because I thought will I enjoy having less fun will it be fun to have less fun okay that's all fun but would it be fun to have less fun and I said maybe instead of spending all of our money doing this stuff we should spend all of our money getting very regimented we should have loads of members of staff and we should be up at exactly 7:46 and we should have a coffee ready and hot at 7:47 and at 8:01 we should go into the gym and we should finish at 827 and we should have all of it we just have everything regimented and we should produce more content than ever before become richer than ever before but just remove the fun and have fun and not having fun and just being monumentally competent and effective okay well I'll try it let me try for 6 months to give up all fun and just be boring and then I learned some very interesting things during that time firstly I learned that the whole idea of drinking for being social is now gone I think I we're at at the age where if you were 21 and you didn't drink you didn't have a life there's no reason to drink for socializing because everything's online anyway you meet everybody on apps nobody cares about drinking anymore that's the first thing I learned the second thing I learned is that being exceptionally regimented is fun I truly enjoy it I enjoy it just as much as I enjoyed being I mean cuz what would happen before is I'd do all my work and I'd train hard and I was always an effective person I was still a thousand times more effective than the average man and then I would take six or seven hours and drink and smoke and have fun and enjoy all my the fruits of my labor I became extreme Rich why not get on a private jet and have fun but now instead of spending those 6 hours having fun I spend those 6 hours continuing to work and I enjoy it just as much so now I'm sitting there going well I enjoy it just as much and I'm not damaging my health I enjoy it just as much and I'm making more money so it really truly ruins my day when a beautiful girl is like can I see you it's like I've got things I've got work to do I'm regimented I have to sit here and type I don't want to just talk to you and have fun and party I don't want to do any of that I want to do emails you don't get it I know to you it makes no sense but you already have all this money why do you want to do emails because that's my fun now regimen so I decided to dedicate six months to being boring and by the end of the six months I was having so much fun being boring that now I will probably never drink again I am 0% tempted to drink ever again I 0% tempted by Fun which is what you said and I completely get it once someone goes we're going to go here and it's going to be fun I'm like n you have fun I'll do do my emails you enjoy I don't want to go to clubs I don't want to go to some party I'm not interested in traveling I'm not interested in seeing anything I've seen it all anyway I've Been Everywhere like who cares I'm above it all I'm over it all I I want to run my Empire and I want to spend time with people I love and I want to beat my brother Uno and that's it I don't want to do anything maybe I've gotten boring maybe I've leaned too much into the boring character but I truly enjoy just being boring and regiment and I like getting as much work done as possible and and that's why I'll never ever drink again so the whole concept of fun is alien to me I totally get it now when you said that you're totally right it's fun isn't Fun and then achieving things in work is Fun the only the only thing I guess I can say I do for fun is driving fast cars but then I need to make $800,000 to buy a Ferrari so it's still it's still work involved you know there's still work involved but I really believe God's given me one of the best lives and I can't complain about anything bad that's happened it's all been fantastic I'm I'm truly thankful for all of I think of a couple bad things happen to you you should be intelligent enough to realize that eventually you're going to get over it and you're going to learn an important lesson it's going to change you in the correct direction and all is the best of planners and he knows what you need to learn I think that as humans especially as men we only learn the hard way anyway there's two ways to learn a lesson the hard way and the hardest way there's no easy way to learn a lesson you have to learn the hard way so God gives us lessons via difficulty he thinks you need to learn this about yourself or this about other people so I'm going to give you a difficult time so you can learn your lesson because if I told you if I just said hey Andrew this is how the world Works you'd go yeah yeah but when I show you when you feel it my fight coach used to say you have to feel it to believe it that's why he if he was teaching low kicks he he'd kick your leg off because you don't believe in the power of a low kick you don't believe a low kick can be so devastating unless you felt it you have to feel it to believe it so God will give you a difficult time so you learn your lessons and the lessons are very important for you to be the person who you need to be in this life he's the best of planners and I'm thankful for all the lessons he's given me he's bestowed knowledge upon me I would be how could I not be grateful to God for making me so intelligent and wise and the ability to look into things so deeply and come up to the right decision and basically predict the future perfectly you have to have difficulty happening to you all the time so when you sit and say I want an easy life what you're saying is you you're a dummy and you want to be a dummy you want to stay a dummy I want an easy life and I don't want anything back to happen to me because even though it will teach me lessons I'm too big of a I can't handle the emotional pain I can't handle the stress I don't want to be a dummy I want to be smart if I want to be smart then hurt me I just know that I become a more formidable more competitive version of myself after every single bad thing that's ever happened to me it's one less thing to fear it's one less thing to be worried about I've done it before because it's also very interesting because you talk about wisdom you use the word wisdom and I appreciate the compliment I don't read books I never read a book because I don't have time all of the wisdom I have all of this knowledge I speak all of these things I say have been learned through basically difficulty of life through professional fighting and being poor and and all bad things happening to me and struggle all of my lessons have been bad things bad things bad events bad scenarios bad situations pain suffering anger resentment all of these horrible emotions are how I've learned everything so I thank God for giving them to me and anyone who wants an easy life wants to stay a dummy what do you learn if you just get money you you buy a cryptocoin it blows up you get some money you go to some restaurants what do you learn about anything completely and then the thing is so interesting is that the people who are choosing the safe option is actually choosing the most risky option so you're not taking a safe option you're taking a coward's way out and it leads to exactly where a coward's way should lead cowards in the end do not get to enjoy the shade of the Olive Tree cuz unless you fought in the arena unless you've been a gladiator you never get the peace of mind and peace of heart which is afforded from bravery so if you choose the safe choices in life thinking oh I'm going to take the safe route you don't end up anywhere safe the safe option doesn't work anymore you need to take risks you need to try and start your own business you need to go all in on things you need to go wild you need to be a man who's not afraid to stand up and think [ __ ] it it's all on my back and I'm going to find a way to pull this off cuz any other way any other option in the world today only leads to a bad scenario the safest thing you can do are the riskiest things that's that's the now scenario where every single gamble I've taken which was seen as risky all paid off for me because I dedicate myself completely so how do you find happiness happiness is in struggle the struggle and the size of the struggle you're facing along with how important it is and how important you feel it is deep in your heart is directly correlated to how successful and how happy you're going to feel all of the time struggle is extremely important for a man and you should be looking to inject struggle into your life perfect we talked about this in the P past emergency meeting because if you're injecting struggle and that struggle solving those problems lead to a positive Place once you become addicted to it you're going to become a machine of monumental achievement there are some very simple basic things you can do weight training chess having debates trying your very best to take care of your mother retire her make sure that your people who you love are taking care of you need goals and resistance and something to fight against to live well because the distance between pain and joy is what we experience if you only have joy all of the time and no pain you are not going to be happy you don't need drugs you don't need alcohol you don't need parties or festivals you don't need fun fun is the vector from which Satan operates every time you look at something which is fun it's all just head inis sck there's no money to be made you don't retire your mother you don't help the world you don't give to charity you don't become stronger you don't become wiser you don't learn anything next time you think of what is fun and someone goes guys come it'll be fun sit there go wait wait wait wait wait wait wait will it experiences are unique jail was a unique experience bunch of fun unique life's not about fun as a man life is about doing the right thing because it must be done now there are some things that are fun which can be earned and there are some things which are fun that you could do which perhaps involve skill driving a Supercar around a racetrack is fun it involves skill you have to be good at what you do cool but a lot of this fun that is easily accessible to everyone because not everybody can get a Ferrari on a closed racetrack I can you can't cuz you're poor you do not need fun until you've already reached the highest possible Echelon so this whole idea that you need fun in your life you don't what you need is purpose you need discipline you need hard work you need things to do which are going to benefit you and the others around you you need Duty you need obligations and you need performance metrics you need people around you who are going to hold you accountable you don't need to be waking up thinking about fun you're nobody's you're not important nobody knows who you are you're not physically strong you're not financially wealthy you have bigger concerns you're obsessed with this idea of fun hey what we going to do this weekend we need to have some fun do you do you need fun do you deserve it really have you actually gone out there in the universe and made a mark large enough that you're allowed some time off to have some fun you don't deserve any fun you don't need any fun you have work to do your obsession with fun is holding you back these things you think are fun aren't fun checking your bank balance at in your house not going out you're not on a club and seeing 20 million dollar liquid is very fun right much more fun than anything you could possibly ever do so although it wasn't fun to sit around and accumulate that kind of wealth it's the funnest thing in the universe in a way for a man your contentment will come from your purpose and it will come from your competence and it will come from succeeding objectives it will come from completing difficult things that other people cannot complete it will never come from the easily accessible Hedonism which you have confused for fun if everybody can do it you shouldn't want to do it if everybody can go to that concert you shouldn't want to go if everybody can go to that club you shouldn't want to go you should only want to do things others can't do the only fun I have is doing things I know you're not allowed to do putting my Bugatti on an A380 and flying around the world to a racetrack which I've rented out for only me and only my friends to race around cars you can't do that I can that is fun but if you say to me Andrew come to this party and I say well who's there everyone oh everyone's there does that mean I need to go right it's the it's the event of the century o everyone's there if everyone's there it's trash so you need to sit there and go all right I'm being asked to do something fun who else can do this and if the answer is everybody stop I clear my emails I've trained hard that day I've made a couple million I've specked a brand new car I've checked on all the people I love all the people I care about I've donated some money to charity my children are fed their mothers are taking care of everything is in order everything is in its proper place that is fun if you say to me Andrew skip a portion of that skip a portion of that organization and professionalism so that we can go and do something that everyone else can do my answer will be no that does not sound fun to me and the fact that you think that's fun shows that you have a severe mental deficiency stay away from it you're only going to find actual fun through purpose and you're only going to find purpose through exceptionalism so you need to become the best possible version of yourself in all Realms that's extremely important the reason you are so unhappy is because you were trying to have fun you're unhappy because you're trying to have fun instead of trying to become important they are very different things and you're never going to feel satisfied in your heart unless you become important please imagine and being important is fun oh it's absolutely fun please imagine and I don't State this with arrogance please imagine for a second you're the most Googled man on the planet and you're a kickboxing world champion and you have hundreds of millions of dollars and you're built like a tank imagine how you feel when you look in the mirror nothing can match that and nothing can beat that as a man you need to have struggle in your life and I want you guys to actually sit and think what struggle are you going through daily what struggle are you undertaking what struggle are you trying to overcome cuz you should make a list to them I can know for myself every single day I wake up I train physically every single day I have to go through x amount of physical pain when my day begins that is a struggle that must be completed that I must try and keep my massive Empire online see my children take care of everybody there's struggle involved my life is difficult difficult lives are fulfilling cuz we used to have to hunt and fish and go out there and go through difficulty to survive and I often see that when I speak to people who are too comfortable they end up being unhappy yeah you can't entertain yourself to happiness you must earn happiness you must climb a mountain you must struggle yourself to happiness that's extremely important there must be physical mental social creative some kind of spiritual struggle and those things being satisfied is what's going to satisfy you it's like Bitcoin Bitcoin is a mathematical equation you solve the equation you get a Bitcoin life is very much the same there's struggles there's difficulties which you have undertaken which you have adopted to try and complete and when you finish those things then you get satisfaction as a reward that's the Bitcoin the the only other alternative to that to feel good is Hedonism which is drugs and alcohol and that's not going to satisfy you for very long and it's also going to destroy your life so it's extremely important this is actually why people are addicted to video games young men are addicted to video games because it mimics virtually what they ought to be doing in the real world yeah effort in to upgrade their character to become a better version of themselves so they can do better things than they could previously do and explore new areas of the map the areas of the map which are Bugatti convention flying there on a private jet to sit with billionaires the grand Monaco is a pool area of the map that you you have not unlocked yet but it's great which requires you to upgrade your character as a person you understand this in video games and you do it in video games because it's very interesting to do however you don't want to do it in the real world but in the real world it's so much more rewarding and I actually going to argue that we're living in one of the PE final periods where that's true I've say in a few Generations who you are and who your physical body is may not matter nearly as much no but it does matter today a lot exactly so that's why you should should enjoy it while you can yeah so you need to pick the lwh hanging fruit first and the starting block to all of these things is your body I believe if you lift stretch move improve your body try and train MMA learn how to fight get stronger get bigger muscles it's a fast track to self-discipline which will carry over into all other endeavors and I would argue that is nearly impossible in fact how many people can say the gym saved their life how many people do you know were depressed started training got in fantastic shape and weren't depressed anymore it is very easy the loow hanging fruit is your body and upgrading your body that is the easiest struggle which is never going to backfire on you and never going to be a negative towards any other facet of your life and when I look at men who are physical specimens I think everyone naturally does this but I'm going to openly say it I respect them differently than I look at men who aren't I have a different level of respect for them because they show me they have discipline they show me they have motivation they show me they're capable of doing difficult and hard things those are the kind of people I trust they're not afraid of struggle they're problem solvers people who train are problem solvers and you need to become one and you need to become very very Adept at solving problems pretty quickly I actually find it amazing that there's people out there who aren't in perfect physical condition guys let me tell you all a news flash if you eat right and you train hard you look good yeah it's like a biological certainty it's almost impossible to be fat and look bad if you eat right and train hard your body will react and give you exactly what you want so why don't you all look like superheroes do you not understand how intimidating that is just when they look at a group of people and they all look like superheroes and they can tell they're all disciplined all hardworking all dedicated all physically strong the struggle is what's beautiful about it that's the most important thing that's what you have to understand yeah because no matter how rich you are no matter how smart you are no matter what family you're born into you can only get into shape the same way as everybody else so you can be Mark Zuckerberg who's now in shape and he's a billionaire but you can't say oh he bought it he didn't buy it he's just in great shape because he earned it like everyone else you be flat broke or Rich As [ __ ] if you in good shape you had to earn it it's as simple as that so yeah it says a lot about who you are as a person first you want to become as strong as physically possible so you want to be as strong as physically possible next you want to try and make as much money as possible not even necessarily for the money although money is extremely important because it allows you to take care of yourself we talked about this before but there's a challenge involved and solving that challenge is going to make you feel more satisfied as a human happiness comes from success and making money is Success you should try and make people around you smile and be happy you should try and encourage positivity around you you should be the kind of person that no one can really complain about their struggles around because they know that you're the person who's going to be like why are you complaining when you could just simply fix it especially the successful people successful people are uninterested in stealing because we'd rather everybody win and keep the friendship and keep the network and keep the positive orgones and keep the good karma than make a little bit extra money so it's amazing what you see in the world if you become a person who is happy and successful and can and take care of himself and adopt struggles you're going to start finding those other people who do the same thing and then you're going to build a network and become Fantastic live with men you're in competition with so you and your friends need to have friendly competition at all times now you need to meet your friends and you need to have banter and competition around things that matter who's got the most money who's worked hardest who's discovered XY Z crypto stock new way of generating income who's trained that day who has the most children puts some actual competitions together that matter and start competing and being around people because you are the some of the Five People You spend the most time with everybody knows this so why do you get some genuine metrics that will improve your life you won't have time to stand around cooking meals if you're friends with somebody who works out for three hours a day for example because you're going to need to find three hours a day to train to beat him which means you're going to have to just eat that rotisserie chicken as you do squats like a man should live with men you're in competition with this is ultra important because you can measure yourself against your circle if Tristan comes downstairs and said I've done a th push-ups I will do anything it takes to do a th and one just to annoy him because I know that he then has to do a thousand and two and pissing him off is worth it it's always worth it and that's why you need to have that kind of competition get your act together get some genuine metrics things that matter and once they're all put together you're going to live in a naturally competitive environment which is going to increase your testosterone level it's going to prevent you from doing a lot of dumb [ __ ] and the competition one's great you know cuz you can apply it to everything there a lot of people are going to get you know kicked in the nuts and and take a fall and they're going to let it beat them down you know Andrew's lost very important kickboxing matches did he quit fighting then did I quit fighting when I got my ass kicked a couple times no you don't you just have to continue because in life there are only winners and losers there are no participation trophies there's no you know stickers and everyone's invited to have a good time you know life is hard and everyone in life is actually trying to play the same game if you're a sportsman there's a small pool of people who compete at kickboxing professional soccer and the bigger the pool is the more difficult it is well life is the only game where every single one of us 8.1 billion people is trying to play the exact same game and the same game is there's only so much money in the world there's only so many resources there's only so much happiness I'm going to try to provide for my family as best as I can and whether people say money is not important or is important everyone's part of this game so winning is very difficult and you have to keep trying when you get when you get kicked and you fall down and that's the advice I give to every every young man who listens to me people are afraid of accepting there's a problem because then they know they have a responsibility towards fixing it and they don't want to do anything one because they're lazy and two because they're afraid they might lose so they'd rather pretend there's no problem at all and I think I often say to people in a lot of my videos about a lot of other subjects that it's not always the winning and the losing it's it's the fighting in the first place and there's plenty of men in history you remember who ended up losing in the end and Napoleon for example who still fought which is why they mattered is not if you're only going to fight when you're guaranteed to win then no bravery is required and you have to fight so that you can look back on your life and feel happy that you tried to do something when you knew it was going on before it was too late forget about the winning and losing for now focus on the fight you must wait for the moment when the opponent's mind is scattered and strike without hesitation if you do not overcome your tendency to give up so easily your life will lead to nothing objectify your demons so you control them instead of them controlling you fear is a reaction courage is a decision you have to train your mind to be stronger than your emotions especially your impulses or else you're going to lose yourself you will only be found by the devil once you are lost and he will lead you to Hell most of the important things in the world have been accomplished by men who kept fighting when there seemed to be no hope at all I think it's a good motto perhaps for life for everyone who's watching this I heard it during a boxing match and I think it was between EV Holyfield against some guy who's not nearly as well known and Holyfield was losing and then he starts swinging hitting the guy and the commentator said suddenly the champion returns with initiative and Vengeance that's a good slogan for life you should wake up look in the mirror and say suddenly the champion returns with initiative and Vengeance that's a good way to start your day every single day yeah it is initiative and Vengeance can become the best possible version of yourself it's very important and this is the last piece of advice I want to give to people at home a lot of people go go through life with a very average attitude and they wait for their one big break but you have to build your big break and you're going to do that with a, tiny victories if you're watching this ask yourself a question when's the last time you genuinely tested yourself when's the last time you genuinely felt challenged win or lose you can be a hero if you just fight win or lose you can be a hero if you make the brave decision there are so many men of history we remember who didn't even win every time Napoleon lost he's still famous his name is still etched into to history you can't escape
