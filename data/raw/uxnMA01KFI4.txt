lgbtq I would argue I don't know what Q is firstly sorry I don't know what you're questioning Q all right LG I would argue that G and T are very different things Beyond a gay man and someone who's chopped the dick off are very different things so they package it all together so now because because the spectrum of your enemy is so large you have people who are complete fully this way you're people who we accept and are normal in society we have no problem with gay people and they put it all together you're an enemy of all these people and they complicate the argument and they mix it all together and I grew up bigot and really you just want your kids to be left alone really just want to leave the children of course all you want to do is leave your kids alone
