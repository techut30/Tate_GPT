    " but we got to mention it now we have the man get off your ass and do something difficult what color is your Bugatti Mr Andrew Tate good to see you sir hey awesome thank you for having me this place is amazing I'm so glad and I want to try to convince you before we start if we can use the headphones why do we need headphones I can hear you perfectly fine I like the idea people think that use headphones for hearing each other yeah I like headphones because for the sensory deprivation that it crea",
    "hones for hearing each other yeah I like headphones because for the sensory deprivation that it creates exactly that's exactly what my enemies want you know I've actually had a beef with headphones people don't realize that I it's kind of funny on the internet they say old Tate had a beef with everything and they're right I guess I did but I always had a beef with headphones and I know we're in a pretty secure setting but I've made many videos saying that headphones are probably the most stupid ",
    "pretty secure setting but I've made many videos saying that headphones are probably the most stupid thing a man can wear I see people wearing headphones in public yes and they're just asking to die yeah I don't know what you're doing you can't hear a car you can't hear me I'm 6' three 100 kilo I can sneak up on you without trying and break your neck so I don't I don't know I'm I'm kind of anti- headphone maybe it's just because it's a principled thing I know that I'm pretty safe here but I'd hav",
    "adphone maybe it's just because it's a principled thing I know that I'm pretty safe here but I'd have to recheck in with the security team and I'm on bail so I can't carry strap and I just feel safer if I can hear the knock at the door you know so that's why we intentionally created the most secure location we could possibly find um I like the headphones because really it helps you focus into the conversation it blocks out the entire world so I know that you're trying to be aware of the world ar",
    "conversation it blocks out the entire world so I know that you're trying to be aware of the world around you but the point is to block out the world so that we focus in on the conversation nothing else matters and I think I think when I record with headphones you kind of almost forget that the world around you exists and it creates kind of this weird space I I believe you but I don't know unmatched perspicacity I'll think about it maybe 10 or 20 minutes in I might put them on for a little while ",
    "d perspicacity I'll think about it maybe 10 or 20 minutes in I might put them on for a little while and test it out but I think I'll be nervous and it's kind of crazy because I say these things and people think I'm nuts but my life's pretty extreme now yeah I mean at the at the back of my mind there's always who's going to knock on the door is it going to be the police or is it going to be the other guys that's always on that's always on my mind all of the time so it's kind of difficult to fully",
    "er guys that's always on that's always on my mind all of the time so it's kind of difficult to fully relax uh so the headphones I'm not sure about I'll think about it I'll do my very best for you because you're a very nice man and You' flown all the way here give me a little bit of time to build up the courage and I'll see if I can put the headphones on if you guys are watching maybe leave a comment should Andrew where the headphones are not I think that'd be an interesting way to start out the ",
    "nt should Andrew where the headphones are not I think that'd be an interesting way to start out the conversation bro but I see people in public with headphones on and I'm you are so killable for the sake of listening to a song you heard 300 times I don't understand how people go through life without ever considering that there might be somebody who wants to remove them from Earth it's insane I had a conversation the other day with a girl she was talking about swimming with sharks or something an",
