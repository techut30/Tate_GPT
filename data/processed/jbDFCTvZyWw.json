    "I always knew the answer to everything is raw action. My dad had a tweet about this. He said that raw action solves all. You just have to say, \"Well, I have to do something.\" Raw action solves. You have to do something. I can't just sit still and die. I knew I wouldn't stay poor. Did I ever think I'd get this rich? No. But it's amazing how the compounding interest of just endless raw action adds up. I've never skipped work. Never never had a day off. There's never been a day where I wasn't doing",
    "p. I've never skipped work. Never never had a day off. There's never been a day where I wasn't doing what I was supposed to do. In my 20s, I spent maybe 10,000 hours in the gym training. You're the same age as me. What did you do with those 10,000 hours? Watch TV, go out, sit around. Nah, don't know. So, if you're 16, you need to be using every single waking minute towards things you're going to remember. You're going to remember training. You're remember working hard.

If I wasn't disciplined enough to train, I would have never seen my talent. You don't get to discover anything about who you are as an individual, your spirit, your soul, what you're made of. Without discipline, you can't even discover anything. You know, there's a whole bunch of people out there that might be the best pian",

Discipline teaches you all about yourself. It teaches you what you really have. I make millions and millions of dollars.

So, it's all about self-control and selfdiscipline and making sure that you are the center of your own universe. And a lot of people agree with this and a lot of people say this, but it's very rare to meet someone who's serious about it. If you're truly serious about root willpower, you can achieve anything.
