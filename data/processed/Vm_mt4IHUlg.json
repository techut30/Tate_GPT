    "in the album I always have to have some sort of epiphany about life I need to have some sort of like reason for why I'm doing anything otherwise I feel like I'm driving towards nothing yeah and then I came up with so close to what which is exactly how I was feeling like I was driving towards nothing I was like this strive for Perfection the strive for the next thing the strive for just like finding like who you are is like a NeverEnding Loop and I felt like this in my career like I was just on t",
    "g like who you are is like a NeverEnding Loop and I felt like this in my career like I was just on tour like you know you make music you you feel proud of something and then there's you don't feel satisfied enough with yourself and then you keep going going and going and it's like when's the point that like when's the Finish Line when's the point where you feel like you've like are are fully satisfied um and so that was like kind of where the idea came from I'm obsessed I do I remember telling I",
    "fied um and so that was like kind of where the idea came from I'm obsessed I do I remember telling I feel like I feel like I mean Jake and I obviously we still work out together every day every day but I like you're like very specific points in the process where I like okay well this might be happening this might not be happening I'll show them songs like this is the next single it's not the next single I'll be like so it's just it's funny cuz I remember you can I say Greenlight was supposed to ",
    "single I'll be like so it's just it's funny cuz I remember you can I say Greenlight was supposed to be the first single yes it was I remember that was the first song I heard from the entire project yes was green light and that was supposed to be the first single and then it was it's okay I'm okay that is that was back in like August or something that was yeah that you've been at you've been working at this on this album for so long well that's the thing like it feels quick but also like I've bee",
    "g at this on this album for so long well that's the thing like it feels quick but also like I've been writing all year like even when when I sent you green light like it was a totally different album dude this album okay so I spent the entire weekend for this album with this album and Tate I cannot emphasize how good it is thank you front to back like on repeat all day every day like it seriously like it was just so like sexy and it was so much it was this like so like your work is always confid",
    "like it was just so like sexy and it was so much it was this like so like your work is always confident and sexy but it was like so much more confident and sexy than anything you've ever done and like it was so good T it's so good and it's so like new everything you're doing is so much newer than anything you've ever done yeah it feels it feels different this time um it just like I don't know why it just feels like different it it can I say it also felt different to me too it felt like full stea",
    "it just feels like different it it can I say it also felt different to me too it felt like full steam ahead I think so it was a lot more bold I think the things that I was like if I was beating around the bush before I wasn't you're not beating around the bush this time you're not beating around the bush at all like it's like oh like you're saying it I had some to say you had some to say y i loved um I just like the opener is so strong missp possessive thank you Payton loves Miss possessive that",
    " um I just like the opener is so strong missp possessive thank you Payton loves Miss possessive that's her favorite that's so funny she's like that's my favorite really yes I was like I love this she was like kept repeating it again and again and again and again and again because I love the can keep it keep up keep it keep up oh yeah that felt like a a good intro um especially because the tour is named missp possessive but I also just I felt like a lot of this album was focused on like stepping ",
    "named missp possessive but I also just I felt like a lot of this album was focused on like stepping into my 21-year-old like woman self right and so I feel like this album felt a lot more feminine than previous albums especially missp possessive because I kind of like the fact of just like owning the fact of being like back the up from my man like you don't usually want to say that but I'm like yeah yeah I'm going to say that well that's and I also loved um well well can we talk purple lace bra ",
    "ah yeah I'm going to say that well that's and I also loved um well well can we talk purple lace bra okay yeah because what it means is something entirely different than what I thought it meant okay what did you think it meant I thought I mean because it can be a couple different meanings I thought it was about a man I thought it was about a man in your life MH and the the actual meaning of it I think makes it I mean I it's besides signs it's my favorite song on the album but it makes it so much ",
    "ink makes it I mean I it's besides signs it's my favorite song on the album but it makes it so much it has it makes it have so much more depth your meaning of it yeah can like well I'll explain um well so yeah it can be interpreted as a relationship as well um but I remember I was actually on vacation remember when I went to Bora Bora this year yes right after your tour yes and I had like a week off and I was just like I was just like writing things in my journal and reflecting on life and I kep",
    "ff and I was just like I was just like writing things in my journal and reflecting on life and I kept writing like would you hear me more if I acted like this or would you hear me more if I talked like this or if I wrote like this feeling like sometimes I just like wasn't being like heard and um then obviously like I dropped a couple music videos and it was just interesting my relationship with the media this year was was kind of like what this song talked about it just kind of felt like you kno",
    "e media this year was was kind of like what this song talked about it just kind of felt like you know I would feel confident one day and empowered one day and feel like like in my own skin and then it'd be completely misunderstood the next day and as a Girl who's Trying to like figure out you know try to feel comfortable in your skin for the first time that's such a conflicting thing to go through like it would just like with my head cuz I'm like okay am I feeling confident and sexual or am I fe",
    " like it would just like with my head cuz I'm like okay am I feeling confident and sexual or am I feeling sexualized right now I really don't know the difference and that was like really weird so I think this song was kind of just like my conversation to the media being like I don't think you're like really listening to what I'm saying or what I'm doing like I'm at the end of the day like even if the video is a video like it's okay I'm okay which is a pretty crazy like like video you know what I",
    "the video is a video like it's okay I'm okay which is a pretty crazy like like video you know what I mean yes it's like for me it was about like the art of it like the pop of it and the culture of it and um I think sometimes like that can be just like misinterpreted a lot is a frustrating thing to go through the time I know how frustrating it is for you I see it all the time yeah and it's weird too because like just like getting that many opinions you know I'm just like some days I walk in I'm l",
    "o because like just like getting that many opinions you know I'm just like some days I walk in I'm like oh my God like I feel crazy you're also like so like like their 20s is like such an age where like everyone's opinion seems like it matters do you know what I mean at least that's like I don't know if that like I feel like that we feel like we both share that feeling where it's like everyone's opinion matters at all time but it's so different for you cuz you I always I've always said this to y",
    "pinion matters at all time but it's so different for you cuz you I always I've always said this to you like as a pop star like you are like you it requires you to like really bear yourself like metaphorically like like you're like being like sexy and stuff but no I'm serious when you're getting like everyone's opinions and you're like sexy and stuff and like everyone's commenting on the video and this that the third you're like oh my God shut the up yeah yeah it is yeah am I wrong like why is so",
    "this that the third you're like oh my God shut the up yeah yeah it is yeah am I wrong like why is so funny right no you are right it is like it doesn't back feel like that Jake yeah um cuz I would know yeah you you you nailed it that's exactly how feel sometimes but it is it is conflicting because you're like I am like me and you are like we are putting ourselves on display not me as much like you like you bear so much of your life so much of your life right in like music that you have to perfor",
    " like you bear so much of your life so much of your life right in like music that you have to perform every single night to a bunch of different people right yeah it's it's weird sometimes it's hard to separate like um the art of it and yourself cuz you feel like it's sometimes always a personal attack sometimes you're just like oh my God am I a bad person like for doing this or for like getting one hate comment you just feel like the worst person alive do sorry no and then you like that's I mea",
    "ne hate comment you just feel like the worst person alive do sorry no and then you like that's I mean I wasn't going to really say anything else I was just talking do you ever feel like one bad comment like outweighs a thousand good ones oh I and the problem is is you I search for it like I know you do my therapist actually told me the other day she was like you are addicted to like finding like the hurt in situation she's like you dig for it like I look for for it right and that's so not good I",
    "he hurt in situation she's like you dig for it like I look for for it right and that's so not good I know but sometimes you like you it's almost like you you're like it's like the your anxiety is like telling you it's there and your anxiety isn't going to shut up until you find it and prove and you prove it right find yeah it's very masochistic yeah what does that mean it's like what is it like you like love the toxicity of it you enjoy the torture of it oh cool sometimes I'm like I don't know a",
    "u like love the toxicity of it you enjoy the torture of it oh cool sometimes I'm like I don't know anything same I feel the same um okay so can you I'm just like I need to go through like every song on this album yeah we yeah what we do it's just like we talk every single day so it's like every question I have has been answered you know what I would like to talk about the leag when that album got leaked yeah when cuz you cuz you put so much of yourself in that for so many months like take me thr",

    "lly feel like I was that affected by it until like an hour later I was just like sobbing for 10 hours straight cuz I was just like oh my God I didn't really realize how much um I cared about this like this is my whole life these aren't just like songs you start to realize like there there's a lot of that gets put into these songs and real stories and then for it to not be delivered the way you want it to is a frustrating thing as an artist and also because like things weren't done it was 5 weeks",
    "t it to is a frustrating thing as an artist and also because like things weren't done it was 5 weeks until the release which is crazy and it kind of it it kind of just like feel like you feel like you kind of just get all your bit of control of like being an artist and getting to release your craft how you want when you want and and then it's like ah then it's up to you guys it's like I they fully like took that away from me which is crazy but I just remember I was just like at dinner that night",

    " I came back in I was like I'm good now like I feel like a different girl and then 30 minutes later i' like start crying again because there's just nothing you can do like there's nothing and that's the worst feeling in the entire world when there's nothing you can do yeah and you and I think especially as like someone who what you do with like art is you if something sounds off you go in and fix it if something is weird you go in and fix it and I'm very um if there's a problem I find a solution",
    "it if something is weird you go in and fix it and I'm very um if there's a problem I find a solution immediately and I was just like oh my God there's I I can't find a solution to this because I literally can't do anything cuz they already have it so I think yeah that was frustrating and sorry I mean it's okay I mean it it it is okay and like everyone did a really good job at like making sure like it went away and I feel like your fans are so good about that too and like yeah they were sweet abo",
    " it went away and I feel like your fans are so good about that too and like yeah they were sweet about it I saw online like a bunch of stuff about like them like I feel like that's so like you that you found out through your fan is such a testament to the community you created I know and they and they were like I don't want to listen to it yet and I'm like G that like that means so much to me I'm just like the leakers you suck what else are you doing with your life like nothing it just it was ju",
