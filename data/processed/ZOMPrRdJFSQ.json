    "you talk a lot about purpose why we are created as humans and why we are here like what is the purpose of life why have we been given life I think we're here to struggle and to learn I don't think we're here to be happy that's why when we keep going back to the Happy argument I've always found that kind of frustrating and annoying and someone goes oh but I want to be happy why why do you want to sit there and laugh like like you were happy your entire childhood that's your happy days you're allo",
    "it there and laugh like like you were happy your entire childhood that's your happy days you're allowed to be happy as it is it's all over now right you're a man you have responsibilities I think we're here to do important things and important things are going to be difficult and they're going to be hard and you're going to get frustrated but that's what gives you purpose I think we're here to struggle I think we're here to endure pain I think we're here to just see how hard we are to kill I thi",
    "uggle I think we're here to endure pain I think we're here to just see how hard we are to kill I think that going through terrible things and living through them and and coming out the other side is one of the most fantastic things about being human I think that it's it's almost like once you understand what life is really about there's no emotion which isn't enjoyable the only emotional state which can be seen as detrimental is feeling nothing at all but if you're sitting at home and you're fee",
    "ch can be seen as detrimental is feeling nothing at all but if you're sitting at home and you're feeling truly heartbroken at least you're feeling something right and I think that's the whole part of Being Human I think we're here to struggle I think we're here to go through pain I wake up each day and go what can I attack what problem can I solve and and look at history why did Genghis Khan wake up and want to conquer the whole world why did Napoleon conquer the world why did Alexander the Grea",
    "up and want to conquer the whole world why did Napoleon conquer the world why did Alexander the Great Congress Mill did you just wake up and just say give me this give me I want all of it there's an army there they're really big we're better it's intrinsic you need to go and Conquer that's that's the purpose of life do you believe that God created us so why did God create us to struggle because if you don't struggle you don't learn God created us to learn and understand ourselves and understand ",
    " you don't struggle you don't learn God created us to learn and understand ourselves and understand other people and understand the world and what did I say earlier I said that you don't learn a lesson without pain so you have to struggle to learn anything there's only two ways to learn things the hard way or the harder way if you're smart you can learn the hard way but in my experience 99 of the plan to only learn the hardest possible way if you want to feel happy inside of yourself and you wan",
    "plan to only learn the hardest possible way if you want to feel happy inside of yourself and you want to feel content and you want to feel stable inside of yourself you need to live true to God and I'm not saying you can't drink a little bit of alcohol or not party or not have a little bit of fun but you have to be a good person I don't believe in the societal paradigms in which they have tried to construct this idea of happiness I don't believe or subscribe to the way that happy and sad is curr",
    " construct this idea of happiness I don't believe or subscribe to the way that happy and sad is currently understood by the masses of the population I think if you are anything less than absolutely distraught you are happy you're a version of Happy it's like saying gray is a version of black right no matter how light the gray is you can still call it a version of black and unless you've gone through an event which hopefully doesn't happen too often like the passing of a family member or somethin",
    "gh an event which hopefully doesn't happen too often like the passing of a family member or something that's truly destructive and detrimental to your mindset besides these events which hopefully only happen a few times in your life you should be happy if you're not crying or paralyzed in silence due to the absolute magnitude of a detrimental circumstance or the absolute magnitude of a negative event then you are a version of Happy so I am always happy is the short answer I don't believe in not ",
    "ent then you are a version of Happy so I am always happy is the short answer I don't believe in not being happy I don't believe in not saying to myself I'm happy I'm always a version of Happy and this chasing this idea of chasing happiness and always being concerned and preoccupied with how happy you are is actually the biggest mistake that a lot of people make I think in the world today especially men who wake up and go oh I don't really feel happy so I need to get happier and that's how they e",
    "y men who wake up and go oh I don't really feel happy so I need to get happier and that's how they end up down a hedonistic path of drugs or alcohol or gambling chasing pleasure I don't care how I feel I don't care if I feel happy or sad it doesn't really affect what I do each day I do the exact same things I act the exact same way I don't care I don't put weight to the significance of the emotion so I always consider myself a happy person but if I woke up and I was slightly less happy one day t",
    " so I always consider myself a happy person but if I woke up and I was slightly less happy one day than another it wouldn't affect anything I do and I wouldn't put any relevance to it I'm human and that's life so yeah am I any happier now that I have hundreds of millions of dollars than before I was broke not really but I was never unhappy I'm I'm the same state that I was then that I am now I have work to do and I will do it it's well also there's no light without dark and there's no joy withou",
    "e work to do and I will do it it's well also there's no light without dark and there's no joy without pain you can't have a rainbow without little rain no matter how hard you chase pleasure and happiness there's going to be dips and troughs in between there's gonna be come downs and downtrends and you're going to have the juxtaposition between that time you were laughing your head off and acting Yiddish like a child and the time that you feel depressed as such and I think it's much better to jus",
    "iddish like a child and the time that you feel depressed as such and I think it's much better to just adopt a very disciplined stoic mindset I'm always the same base level of happy regardless if I lost all of my money today I would be the same happy if my net worth quadrupled I'd be the same happiness but as long as I'm alive and the people I I care about and love are alive and as long as I get as long as God gives me the honor of doing my duties and providing for the people I care about as long",
    " long as God gives me the honor of doing my duties and providing for the people I care about as long as I get to wake up and know that there's a whole bunch of people in the world who need me and I get to work hard to please them and do good for society and good for the world then then I'm a vessel of God and I'm happy I'm happy enough to survive that's all I look at it as I don't ever consider how do I across my mind I used to do I'm too busy I have things to do every single day I have very imp",
    "w do I across my mind I used to do I'm too busy I have things to do every single day I have very important things to do and how I feel really is not going to affect how I complete those tasks anybody can be steady when there is no storm the true skill set of a leader is To Be steady in a storm not hysterical not anxious but steady in the storm you are closer to there than you have ever been before but God is not big on details he tells you we're going to the other side he does not tell you what'",

    "e but in the process of getting there Stone survives the one thing that we all have in common black or white rich or poor short or tall the one thing I could guarantee you that all of us will face male or female it's a storm there is nobody you're going to meet or fall in love with that will avoid the fact that storms are built into God's plan you have to know that he equipped you with a fire extinguisher and an emergency exit and an automated system that even when you can't see him you can hear",
    "nguisher and an emergency exit and an automated system that even when you can't see him you can hear him and if you will follow his voice you will get to the other side the first thing we do when we get in the storm is to try to fix the storm the storm is not yours to fix you cannot fix the storm and this drives you crazy but it's particularly difficult for men because we are raised to fix stuff and there are some women who feel that way too you feel like you've failed if you don't fix it you lo",
