    " up examples of grooming in my own town of Rochdale for example they did it for reasons and this is my point so Muslims should stand up and say we don't need this we don't want this we don't advocate for this this is extremely important if you want to be accepted I I you know a lot of Muslims have been mad at me for this point of view but I've sat there and said when this happens if if Islamic men commit these heinous crimes and the government covers up for them and then the far right gets angry",
    " commit these heinous crimes and the government covers up for them and then the far right gets angry and then instead of Muslims saying up saying standing up saying this is wrong they say oh you just hate Muslims you're advocating for and you're perpetuating the problem I think I think the only way you make the problem go away is you go up to every body of any political ideology of every race it doesn't matter what it is and say this is wrong and these people do not deserve protection under the ",
    "oesn't matter what it is and say this is wrong and these people do not deserve protection under the law Well it's worse if a sex abuser is a Muslim because he's pretending to be a believer in God and a follower of the Prophet just as it's worse if a Catholic priest is a sexual abuser Absol not something to be covered up it's something to be more energetically well in an Islamic in an Islam country they they fa the death penalty in most of them so this is not the fact that Islam supports these th",
    " they they fa the death penalty in most of them so this is not the fact that Islam supports these things but this perpetuation and this conflation comes from the fact that the government covers it up and then when it's finally exposed not enough Muslims stand up on side of the far right saying look I don't care what religion they are I don't care what race they are you cannot cover up crimes uh subjectively for one group of people and not the others instead Muslims stand up and try and say islam",
    "bjectively for one group of people and not the others instead Muslims stand up and try and say islamophobia or whatever and this causes the divide that the far right want this is the divide that everybody's been looking for all of this time you can't give your enemy bullets and then be complaining when they shoot them so if we want to live in a Multicultural Society I think it's extremely important that all Muslims stand up and say what happened was heinous what happened was wrong what happened ",
    "t that all Muslims stand up and say what happened was heinous what happened was wrong what happened shouldn't ever happen again and under the law we do not require or expect special protection if you're going to start saying to the British government we want to be treated differently than the native British people well now you're going to have a big problem Maybe not today but sooner or later so I think we should all be treated fairly I don't think there's anything wrong with requesting that or ",
    " think we should all be treated fairly I don't think there's anything wrong with requesting that or asking for that no of course now look uh let's move on to uh brav for American viewers and others around the world brav is a kind of [__] abbreviation of brother I ain't no liberal brav is something you've heard me say uh because it's true but brav BR UV it's a bit of a genius name you've come up with Britain restoring underlying values thank you so are you serious about it deadly serious absolute",
    "th Britain restoring underlying values thank you so are you serious about it deadly serious absolutely serious I think that the UK needs some a new lease of life in politics that's going to Galvanize and motivate the youth to go and vote I don't know the exact statistics but it seems that the young people in the UK have basically zero interest in politics when it comes to voting none at all and I see some of these constituencies are being won with 30,000 40,000 seats it's not even that many real",
    "see some of these constituencies are being won with 30,000 40,000 seats it's not even that many really um it's truly incredible that we have the Youth of the of the country which are suffering greatest at the hands of these insane policies which are being pushed by the current government and they have no interest in political solution whatsoever so what we're going to have for a long time is apathy before explosion once people don't believe in the political solution what's the other solution let",
    "y before explosion once people don't believe in the political solution what's the other solution let's let's all be realist the solution is violence so once all the young people in the world or the young people of the UK have lost all interest in politics they're getting screwed over left and right they don't believe there's political solution they continue to be screwed over left and right eventually it's going to it's going to erupt into something like we just described at Southport so I think",
    "ally it's going to it's going to erupt into something like we just described at Southport so I think it's extremely important we offer a political solution and young people are not as politically correct perhaps as the older Generations they want answers interesting observation and true no it's true they want answers with my own children yeah they want answers they want solutions they all have Tik Tok brain they scroll all day every day CH most most teenagers can't even focus for two seconds on ",

    "l a Multicultural Society but it felt like Great Britain and I feel like the things that are missing are cultural and they're tangible and it's at a very base level where now when you walk around British cities you walk around the UK it just doesn't feel like Britain anymore and I don't think it's primarily because of immigration although that's probably a large part of it I think it's the lack of interaction between people I think it's the lack of celebration for British culture I think it's th",
    " interaction between people I think it's the lack of celebration for British culture I think it's the absolute demonization of British history I think there's a whole bunch of things which have all concluded in people seeing Britain as just a place they can make money and send money outside the country and and perhaps retire in Spain and leave it's no longer a home it feels like it's something that people are exploiting and using and raping just for the financial benefit and for a country to sur",
