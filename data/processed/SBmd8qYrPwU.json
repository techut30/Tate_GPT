    "this is my father's hand symbol so my father used to do this when he was playing chess he would sit there and he would focus like this and I guess I copied it because that's the whole point of being a son to a father right you're supposed to copy your father in all ways and you're supposed to replicate them and I feel like I've done a very good job of doing exactly that I feel like that's the exact point of even having a son in the first place is for them to be a replica of you me personally I w",
    "t point of even having a son in the first place is for them to be a replica of you me personally I want to create 25 Andrew Tates to cause problems into the future that's what I want to be a little army of troublemakers so I saw my father doing it and I copied it and uh it's a power mudra I think you can a lot of people know that now but there balances the left hemisphere and the right hemisphere of your brain as well right absolutely and uh it works sometimes yeah sometimes you know if I if I i",

    "lluminati and all these kind of things but it's it's interesting to read these it's very interesting when people show them to me online and they they say look we think you're one of this team or one of that team yeah especially as I'm trying so hard to tell the world how things actually work I feel like my arrest though has proven that I'm genuine I feel like that the one thing that they made the mistake with trying to take me down is they proved I'm not on their side so anyone now with a functi",
    "mistake with trying to take me down is they proved I'm not on their side so anyone now with a functioning brain goes okay well he's not in their Club because they're screwing this guy over so anyone who's still out there you know with their social media platforms and jumping up and down and Performing and doing whatever those are the ones but you know how it also is right A lot of these people they think that all right this guy is clearly on that side he's actually genuinely honoring himself and",
    "y think that all right this guy is clearly on that side he's actually genuinely honoring himself and all of that stuff but there's still some sort of hidden agenda because at the end of the day people want to say what they want to say and what they believe so how do you how do you get past that yeah I mean there's there's always going to be people who have theories about you there's always going to be somebody who believes x y and Zed yeah but it's the controversy that makes it interesting like ",
    "o be somebody who believes x y and Zed yeah but it's the controversy that makes it interesting like my brother and I talk about this quite often you need both sides of a story to perpetuate it if it's all just one side of the story and it's accepted truth then it's not interesting so even my haters who say that I've actually committed crimes or the people who say I'm not actually a good guy or whatever and I've joined this team and I'm secretly uh controlled opposition you need both sides becaus",
    "tever and I've joined this team and I'm secretly uh controlled opposition you need both sides because it's both sides and the arguing that perpetuates it you need people who hate you you need people who love you and all my haters do a fantastic job of keeping me extremely relevant and I have to thank them for that so I I have no concerns for certain people in the world disliking me in fact I'm I'm very aware that that's an important side of the coin and I'm glad they exist yeah and I'm glad that",

    "uestion sir I want you I want you to tell me what India like but cuz I got there and it wasn't like I expected it it's it's firstly it's not cheap I stayed in the Four Seasons and I spent more I spent the same money in Mumbai as I did in Dubai yeah it's very expensive true which didn't matter but I guess that just surprised me yeah and then traffic's crazy were you as successful as you are today no I don't think so at that point of it was many years ago um traffic's crazy I had no idea where to ",
    "o I don't think so at that point of it was many years ago um traffic's crazy I had no idea where to go what to do and I think it's a metaphor for the entire world and and life as a whole it's not where you are it's who you're with yep it's the same for every city it's the same even just to quickly go back this summer was I spent the entire summer on house arrest and I had the best summer of my life the best summer of my life because there was like 20 of my friends living in this massive house po",
    "e the best summer of my life because there was like 20 of my friends living in this massive house pool party every day yeah I was seeing I was seeing those videos of yours online as well yeah it was it was it was amazing so it's not about where you are it's who you're with I I'm sure Mumbai could be a lot better than I experienced but I didn't I didn't know what I was doing it's really good it's really fancy but once again it like I mentioned earlier it is the Matrix right you have every type of",
    "eally fancy but once again it like I mentioned earlier it is the Matrix right you have every type of human being over there so staying centered is very very crucial yeah yeah yeah you have to be you you just can't allow yourself to be taken for a ride do you think it has like a you're saying it's very fancy it has like a Dubai Vibe if you know where to go there's all this highend stuff and high bars and you you've been there you've done that so you know what that's like so Mumbai is definitely n",
    "rs and you you've been there you've done that so you know what that's like so Mumbai is definitely not a place that would Fascinate You Anymore whereas there are a whole bunch of places in India that you would love EXP exploring like there's Kashmir it's beautiful it's like Romania isn't it yeah yeah yeah then we have a whole bunch of other places like Rajasthan jaur culturally very very rich and it's such a big country it is huge it's very diverse it is very very diverse like even in Mumbai you",
    "it's such a big country it is huge it's very diverse it is very very diverse like even in Mumbai you must have seen the Four Seasons right besides that there's a slum yep yeah so that's Slum Dog Millionaire for you yeah yeah and and you go I was in Mumbai and people like when are you going to go see the Taj Mahal or Taj Mahal that's a yeah I'm like it's it's it's far it's that people think India is all like y you just go to Mumbai and you see it all BR the minute the minute you're out of this wh",

    " it's like a self- fulfilling prophecy also yeah people say words are powerful and I understand that but I also knew what was going to happen I truly believed it was going to happen and I thought by preempting it and making it clear that it's all a setup it'll make it very easy for the obvious thinking person to understand what's going on so I know that words are powerful but I have a very interesting view on that to be honest because I often say things which I perhaps shouldn't say I don't know",
    "ting view on that to be honest because I often say things which I perhaps shouldn't say I don't know if I'm goting the univer universe I don't know if I'm challenging them but I don't operate from a realm of fear so I'm just not afraid to say certain things whether they come true or not but I knew what they were going to do eventually I knew it was going to happen there was no way that they were going to allow me to continue to be as relevant as I was saying the things that they don't want me to",
    "oing to allow me to continue to be as relevant as I was saying the things that they don't want me to say correct and and that's what the law has that's what the the government has that's how the Matrix Works they have law that's all they have a government solution to everything is law if you go to a government and say we have a problem they say Okay pass a law that fixes the problem so and then they have the legal system so if you upset them they just get the legal system they set the dogs on yo",
