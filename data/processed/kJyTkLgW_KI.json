    "what the [__] is this please are we good or we could have the cigars come in mid-show right Andrew or you want to start with the guard we can do I just want to make sure she doesn't [__] it up whose duty is that yeah who's on who's on cigar Duty right now does chick Tash she's supposed to be getting them is that your girl or assistant it's a check one of my chicks yeah one of my one of my wives I got four wives I'm from Ethiopia that's one of your wives for real is that a girlfriend girlfriend y",
    "got four wives I'm from Ethiopia that's one of your wives for real is that a girlfriend girlfriend yeah I haven't seen her in a minute so wait when you when you bring a girl when you bring like a girl is she a girlfriend or just a girl for the trip girlfriend girlfriend yeah so you like make her you put her on cigar Duty well if I if I need a cigar then I would ask her to go politely get me a cigar yeah what if she said no how could she possibly say no to me what if she's like why why do I have ",
    "r yeah what if she said no how could she possibly say no to me what if she's like why why do I have to get your cigars like get your own cigars why do I have to put you on a private jet to [__] Croatia [__] off then there you go there you go how many how many girlfriends me yeah man I'm a man of God I'm a good man I don't want to be in this podcast I'm trying to tell the world I'm some kind of horrible evil misogynist everyone who seems to think I am for some reason I think it's great to have mu",
    "rible evil misogynist everyone who seems to think I am for some reason I think it's great to have multiple do you yeah why not I mean if they're okay with it yeah well uh do you have like a ranking system like you have a main piece and then Side Girls how does that work I'm a man of God I read the Bible I go to church I don't know I can't possibly answer these questions this is obviously going to be watched by every single female that has any kind of Association to me and I'm loyal to all of the",
    "be watched by every single female that has any kind of Association to me and I'm loyal to all of them that's awesome there you go so do do the math on that one see baby I told you I was loyal don't worry about it so we'll talk to all of you at the same time you think it's possible for a man to to be loyal to one girl I think it's possible for men to do lots of things sure we go to the Moon you'll be a little one girl and go scuba diving if you want to I don't think that if men were truly honest ",
    "be a little one girl and go scuba diving if you want to I don't think that if men were truly honest with themselves that they want to be I think men are loyal to a woman to try and Inspire loyalty out of her a man will sit there and go I only want to be with her but really what they're saying is I only want her to be with me which is a masculine imperative and it's natural and I completely understand that every man is the same but if you could make a woman be loyal to you while not being loyal t",
    "and that every man is the same but if you could make a woman be loyal to you while not being loyal to her then you would not be loyal to her if a man's truly honest and says if I can press this button and she's loyal to me no matter what I do am I still going to only be with her now you might prefer her you might spend 99 of your time with her Etc completely get that but on a long enough time frame for the rest of your human life if she's gonna be loyal to you regardless are you telling me that ",
    "e for the rest of your human life if she's gonna be loyal to you regardless are you telling me that with a without any kind of backlash from her without the chance of her cheating without any [__] you're going to tell me for the next 50 years you're not going to [__] anything ever once if she let you why not like you know what I mean yeah I mean I feel like everyone would agree to that everyone would agree to it right so it's different for men and women it's completed for men and women and it's ",
    "uld agree to it right so it's different for men and women it's completed for men and women and it's also different because a lot of people misunderstand what I say it's different for men of a certain status right if you if you're a man who has his [__] together at a certain level of status you can say to a woman look I love you with all my heart I want to be with you I'm going to take care of you but you're not going to tell me what to do I'm in charge because this is my life you're on the Tate ",
    "but you're not going to tell me what to do I'm in charge because this is my life you're on the Tate train and we're headed to success station I'm the one driving it and if you're gonna be on my train certain things are going to happen if you're unhappy you can get off no problem I feel like you've been experiencing that it's like a high value male me and Saleem kind of just started I'm hoping steiny gets there one day but once you get there it'll be yeah it'll be dope when you get into the high ",
    "ny gets there one day but once you get there it'll be yeah it'll be dope when you get into the high value area it's like it's pretty fire well if you're hard to replace then you're gonna accept more things than you would accept from someone who's easy to replace right this is basic human psychology we can take it away from dating and apply it to basically anything you'll accept your Lamborghini breaking down because it's hard to replace it you will not accept your Toyota breaking down because yo",
    "eaking down because it's hard to replace it you will not accept your Toyota breaking down because you can just go get Nissan so it's the same kind of the game right if you look at a guy and go he is amazing at everything I truly feel I feel happy with this man I can't find another man on his level who could possibly replace him or fill the hole in my life he would leave sometimes he [__] that [__] oh fine you're more like an accepted that's human nature right he's not even about intersexual Dyna",
    " oh fine you're more like an accepted that's human nature right he's not even about intersexual Dynamics and all the things I talk about even though I could use those examples to apply all of my beautiful completely correct logical you know affirmations the reason I don't do that is because everyone comes back because misogynist misogynist misogynist so fine cool stop them all crying let's talk about human nature people are not going to be quick to replace something or attempt to replace somethi",
    "out human nature people are not going to be quick to replace something or attempt to replace something which is basically Irreplaceable so if you're a high enough State it's individual then you get to get away with more that's basic human psychology isn't it as a whole and I think that uh I'm with guys here I'm not I don't have three people I don't have to say I think I could say I know I know I don't think there's any girls in the room is there is yes sir you're good oh I think there's not cool",
    "on't think there's any girls in the room is there is yes sir you're good oh I think there's not cool I know that women as a whole are quite understanding of their status women are very very intelligent I know people say I'm misogynistic and people say I say bad things about women women are very very intelligent in certain key areas and one of the things they are most intelligent at or best at is is reading their own State it's understanding what they can and can't get away with women are experts",
    "s reading their own State it's understanding what they can and can't get away with women are experts at that you get the same chick who acts x-way with one guy and get with a new guy and act completely differently because do you think that subconsciously though like I think it's subconscious but I also think they spend a lot of time on Instagram a lot of time looking at the competition a lot of time looking in the mirror a lot of time trying to look good A lot of times they spend a lot of time o",
    "me looking in the mirror a lot of time trying to look good A lot of times they spend a lot of time on themselves and within themselves and they're pretty good at understanding their value and what they can get away with when it's compared against the value that's sitting opposite them right so they'll sit opposite one guy and be a [__] it's the opposite the next guy and be a sweetheart they're quite smart at that right so it's true so I think that most women actually they get with a guy who they",
    "te smart at that right so it's true so I think that most women actually they get with a guy who they really know has his [__] together they're not going to sit there with that guy and say listen you better not because I'm like if I talk to him that way he's definitely going to do it yeah so they're going to come at a different angle it would really hurt me if you and then once they say it would really hurt me if you then you can then you can apply counters to that in different ways you can just ",
    "ally hurt me if you then you can then you can apply counters to that in different ways you can just simply ask why would that hurt you well if you're [__] all these [__] how do I know I'm special so the only reason you know you're special is because I'm sexually exclusive so if you knew you were special with something else perhaps you did something else with me or I did something else with you that I don't do with anybody else and you would know you were special so what you're worried about me [",
    "t I don't do with anybody else and you would know you were special so what you're worried about me [__] that [__] for and it can't be that logical because females are not that logical you can't explain it that way but I'm saying if you're with a woman long enough and you have frame and you have influence over her and you understand these basic paradigms and you you mention them in the correct conversations that the correct way in the correct frame over time they'll learn to accept it I say this ",
    "ersations that the correct way in the correct frame over time they'll learn to accept it I say this and people completely have a meltdown I don't know why people have a meltdown it's [__] it's facts it's facts you think any of these dudes [__] you think any of these rappers [__] all these girls the girls are telling them you better be loyal you better be loyal [__] no because they couldn't stay us because they don't want to be left because they know he'll just say no bye so they just don't they'",
    " because they don't want to be left because they know he'll just say no bye so they just don't they're like okay look at me in the mirror can I be replaced yes can he be replaced not easily [__] I gotta take this deal that's the game they say is and that's human psychology you can apply that to anything but to the fight game there's an a side b side human inter Human Relationships there's an a side b side business deals there's an a side b side someone's gotta [__] take the B-side to a degree tw",
    "e b side business deals there's an a side b side someone's gotta [__] take the B-side to a degree two degree and but this is the thing about relationships because we can talk about relationships as a whole everyone says what I say is crazy all I say is that love is real men and women should be in love a man can be completely in love with a woman and care about her and still sometimes [__] something else like the higher your status the more you can get away with because that girl's so afraid to l",
    "g else like the higher your status the more you can get away with because that girl's so afraid to lose that so you can do whatever you want bro it's the same but it's the same with anything yeah is it like buy a McLaren it's not it's not gonna work for half the year they're [__] nightmares but they're McLarens it's just a game like I used to talk to Salim and he'd have random girl girls and you'd be like yo I I'm crazy over this chick and I would say Saleem dude think about who you are you can ",
    " be like yo I I'm crazy over this chick and I would say Saleem dude think about who you are you can get any girl you want these are just random chicks right so there's levels to it and I think that I think that chicks don't realize that until they don't have it and then they chase back right well women are also addicted to drama this is something else you have to understand about females that's very true females are addicted to drama they are entertained by drama she watches the Kardashians dram",
    "ry true females are addicted to drama they are entertained by drama she watches the Kardashians drama listen up up I I I don't want to insult anyone I was about to say a [__] yeah I'm sick with that a [__] will sit there a [__] will sit there and think I need to relax let me watch a murder documentary about a serial killer who chokes people's heads off so I have a nice good night's sleep in bed they're addicted to this [__] they love drama so to some degree even as a man this is actually an impo",
    "ey're addicted to this [__] they love drama so to some degree even as a man this is actually an important frame for men to understand to some degree is a man you have to instill drama in the relationship because if you don't she's gonna get bored no that's very true and she's either gonna leave or she will instill the drama which gives her control you don't want her to bring the dress girls girls like to fight oh they like drama they like to be entertained so if she instills the drama it's proba",
    "like to fight oh they like drama they like to be entertained so if she instills the drama it's probably gonna involve some [__] dude you don't want that [__] right so you have to instill drama so this is the question I always say to all the people who say I'm misogynistic and my view and relationships are wrong etc etc I say look I beautiful women who are in love with me and we're all happy and smiling every day I get to [__] whatever I want I have a very positive relationship with females My Li",
    "iling every day I get to [__] whatever I want I have a very positive relationship with females My Life's good you disagree with everything I say but your relationship you and your woman don't even [__] so like if you take the other Paradigm 99 of men disagree with me but they go they marry one chick they be the good guy get married sit with her or just her I'm loyal they're all getting [__] divorced the chick's giving them a hard time you never see that dude who did the right thing and then go I",
    "ed the chick's giving them a hard time you never see that dude who did the right thing and then go I can do whatever the [__] I want cause I do the right thing so you know what leave her at home or hitting the club and do what I want cause I don't cheat never it's like oh she's gonna get mad and he's the good guy say see you next week so what is what is the cheating code in Andrew Tate's like books like How do you morally cheat if you have a girl you're honest with her you're upfront with her it",
    "s like How do you morally cheat if you have a girl you're honest with her you're upfront with her it's not even about that because when I say on these podcasts I have to condense everything I have to be very compendous and I have to try and how does one not entertain how does one more it's just about understanding and instilling a mental frame inside of the female that makes her understand that it's really not that big a deal that coupled with your status and the fact that you're hard to replace",
    "'s really not that big a deal that coupled with your status and the fact that you're hard to replace will make you be able to get away with it and when I said get away with I don't even mean get away with it can be a very honest and open thing I'm telling you man like you'd be most men would be surprised by how deviant women are if you have a woman and you're truly cool and you're truly together and she truly loves you you come home have you been out that you [__] that [__] I did [__] that [__] ",
    "nd she truly loves you you come home have you been out that you [__] that [__] I did [__] that [__] you know what I [__] her but her tits are not as good as yours come here she'll love it she doesn't give a [__] what if she had a better rack though well then she's in trouble right but but I'm saying if the framing is right but it's about the mental framing I say these things and men think I'm full of [__] you have to understand the mental framing I'll give an example if a man if that's your line",
    " of [__] you have to understand the mental framing I'll give an example if a man if that's your line when you come home and you just dog no just compliment the girls racks it's an example no that's that's a design but but I'm talking about the mental framing if a woman gets to a man and his frame is correct that woman over a long enough period of time has the same political views likes the same music likes the same movies has the same friends as him watches the same things on YouTube the same Ne",
    "sic likes the same movies has the same friends as him watches the same things on YouTube the same Netflix shows if you see a woman who loves that man doesn't she do everything the man does so if that man truly believes it can explain to her in a sensible way look I love you I take care of you I pay your [__] rent you're living with me that [__] [__] that [__] who cares I [__] her so what who gives a [__] she ain't here she ain't live in the [__] Penthouse shut up eventually she's gonna be like o",
    " a [__] she ain't here she ain't live in the [__] Penthouse shut up eventually she's gonna be like okay well as long as those girls don't live with you they're a man's frame that's the frame hold on though so what if what if your girl comes home same scenario and goes uh yo your dick is bigger that's not gonna make you happy though bro okay so this this argument is one I've heard so many trillion times they say well if you can do that why can't the woman do that and I can answer it in so many di",
    "times they say well if you can do that why can't the woman do that and I can answer it in so many different ways give your heart this way I I yeah my harshest way is that it goes against the will of God in nature it goes against the way of man for the longest period of human history men had more than one woman every King every Sultan read the Bible read the Quran in most of the world today men still have more than one woman never in history in any book ever in any civilization since the dawn of ",
    "ll have more than one woman never in history in any book ever in any civilization since the dawn of human time have promiscuous women been celebrated ever they have been frowned upon and every single Society ever the main reason paternity because what happens is if I have five girlfriends and they all get pregnant we know who the five guys are in town thank you and we know who the five fathers are yeah thanks well the Father the father for the five kids you know who the kids belong to yeah if yo",
    " yeah thanks well the Father the father for the five kids you know who the kids belong to yeah if you have a woman who's sleeping with five dudes when she gets pregnant nobody knows who the [__] kid belongs to now the DNA test might be able to fix that modern science right but there's a whole bunch of modern science has to work with the devil that shit's new humans evolutionarily grew up until the 1950s 1960s where none of that [__] was doable you had to know who the mother and the father was yo",
    " 1950s 1960s where none of that [__] was doable you had to know who the mother and the father was you had to have a virgin that's what that's why they celebrate virginity in most these places on the planet they can't afford DNA tests if she ain't a virgin I don't know as a fact I'm the I'm the father so I ain't gonna [__] deal with her [__] that's why Virginia is so important most of the world to this day so to come along and say a woman can do it too is disgusting in the eyes of God in the eyes",
    "this day so to come along and say a woman can do it too is disgusting in the eyes of God in the eyes of nature you can come along with science and somehow then try and fix it and prove it so God just wants the boys to just run through changes God wants the Warriors like God's looking down right now and he's like boys I just want you to run through chicks God is up God wants us to God wants the the man the masculine males of Earth to reproduce create his Warriors God needs Warriors what Parable i",

    "hings I've been saying someone like Kylie Jenner is far more difficult to replace because she's more scarce right so then again then she would be able to turn around and try and play the same game back with me I'm not saying that it's all a game and it's all just like a chess match and those kind of things I'm saying these are the basics of human dynamics in human nature and that someone like Kylie Jenner can have you on the planet there's only one of her I I want to actually say something quick",
    "e Jenner can have you on the planet there's only one of her I I want to actually say something quickly before we go into this I am I'm new new to being big on the internet I really don't know what Kylie Jenner looks like wait it's Kylie Jenner yeah that's cap is Kylie Jenner that's a huge cat is Kylie Jenner a guy you have to be Captain that's a huge cat who's the guy you just remember Keeping Up with the Kardashians yeah but who's the dude one Caitlyn Caitlyn oh okay [__] is that cool I thought",

    "verything will be fixed bro I'm talking about Society at large could benefit from that scenario what does that fix because you have to extrapolate it you have to extrapolate it and look at it at the meta point if women can't just sleep with anybody and everybody because they're going to be known for it and shamed for it they're going to be very very selective with who they sleep with if they're very very selective then men are gonna have to be very very slow they're gonna have to be very very ha",
    "ry very selective then men are gonna have to be very very slow they're gonna have to be very very hard working and very very dedicated to becoming a man worth sleeping with so now men are going to be more Honorable Men are going to try harder men are going to be more interested in making sure that they're a person who's upstanding in society women are going to be very selective who they choose they're more likely to stick with a guy through thicken things they don't want to add a new number to t",

    "ou disagree but I'll tell you why tell me why because it's different like if you're looking for a one-night stand and one chick has three bodies and one chick has fifty the chick with 50 is going to give you a way freakier night than the chick with three so I'd maybe go with the girl with 50. you're gonna walk around looking for chicks thinking I want one that smells like a one-night stand though I want one who's been plowed who's gonna give you a freak here yeah I wouldn't want that I don't thi",
