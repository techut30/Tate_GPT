    "why did you get back why did you go to jail [Music] I'm fully aware that I would not have been banned or canceled if I wasn't Andrew's brother if I had played things my way me and Andrew would probably be back in jail [Applause] I jumped off the rock I'm not scared of Jay you want to send me back good because if you send me back you're now gonna have to explain to the world why can they even do that like what is the crime every story all the girls it's only towards Andrew they don't care about t",
    "at like what is the crime every story all the girls it's only towards Andrew they don't care about the truth they just want to spin some negative stories they wanted the Tate Brothers in jail it's us against the world [Music] so when you hear the war Tate you think about Andrew Tate but it's really the brothers Andrew and Tristan Tate and when I think about Tristan Tate I I told him earlier I said you could have gone a completely different ride the guy looks like a Hollywood star he looks like a",
    " you could have gone a completely different ride the guy looks like a Hollywood star he looks like a movie star uh he looks like he could have played James Bond maybe they shouldn't even consider it unfortunate I know they just made the announcement he looks like a real James Bond dresses like one um has the personality of one the ladies love them if you've never seen his pictures just go on Google type in Tristan Tate you'll see what he looks like the looking guy but he's got a completely diffe",
    "e type in Tristan Tate you'll see what he looks like the looking guy but he's got a completely different identity to himself very different than Andrew we had a very good time talking to Andrew uh your brother and the way he built you up today was very unique I've seen you guys talk to each other about each other but the way he did it today was very different anyways Tristan it's good to have you on the podcast it's good to finally yes last time we met in Madrid but we never did a podcast for ab",
    "on the podcast it's good to finally yes last time we met in Madrid but we never did a podcast for about 60 seconds I was saying I was eating Spanish paella the night before I cracked one of my teeth and the next morning Andrew wakes me up saying okay let's go to Patrick's podcast and I had this big swollen face so I hid inside of my hotel but I did catch you for about 45 seconds by reception because we were staying in the same place yeah and you thought I'd been in the fight I thought because yo",
    "se we were staying in the same place yeah and you thought I'd been in the fight I thought because you guys fight I'm like this guy probably gotten too far apparently now I know he lost her some muscles but not the good kind of yes yeah not the good kind so here's my question for you when we read the stories about why you know Andrew's Gone to prison or Andrew this or this woman came out or that woman came out why did you go to jail why did you get banned why did they take your Instagram down I m",
    "man came out why did you go to jail why did you get banned why did they take your Instagram down I mean I remember the pictures it was all cars and suits and motivational stuff so is it Guilty By Association it is Guilty By Association I hate to say it but I'm fully aware that I would not have been banned or canceled or probably ended up in jail if I wasn't Andrew's brother but there are so many benefits that come with being Andrew's brother that you have to take the Google It didn't upset me to",
    "enefits that come with being Andrew's brother that you have to take the Google It didn't upset me too much no I smiled about it what does this positive attitude come from you could be the victim oh Andrew you you did this yeah you landed me in jail look at all our assets are seized yet smile on your face as gracious just humble guy where did all this come from you know it's always been the way me and Andrew are and we've shared in our successes um the first time he became first time he became a ",
    "and Andrew are and we've shared in our successes um the first time he became first time he became a millionaire we celebrated when I became a millionaire we celebrated when um you know we bought our first Supercar we drove that home from the dealership together so every single positive moment in my life the first time we ever charted a private jet I remember we were just happy drinking having a great time on the on the plane this before he reverted before anybody jumps on that drinking reference",
    "eat time on the on the plane this before he reverted before anybody jumps on that drinking reference but if you want to take all the good moments from having a relationship a brotherly relationship like me and Andrew have and then he becomes the world's most Googled man one of the most influential men I guess in in the world and by default he's attacked by The Matrix in a way that and ends up with him being thrown in prison I feel like I'd be more mad if I didn't go to prison with him I'd feel l",
    " him being thrown in prison I feel like I'd be more mad if I didn't go to prison with him I'd feel like you know I've taken all the good from being associated with Andrew and you know he builds me up and I build him up and for him to be sitting in jail without me it would just feel wrong so I'm not even mad about it I'm the opposite of mad about it I'm glad they wrote me and I'm glad they said Guilty By Association I'm glad they throw me in jail with them and if they frame him for real and send ",
    "lty By Association I'm glad they throw me in jail with them and if they frame him for real and send him back they better send me back too or I'll break myself in you make yourself I'll break into the gym right you know seduce one of the prison guards or something smart I can't see you doing something like that I can't see you doing something like that but you did give a good book recommendation earlier I appreciate that which was great it's a inside joke but uh uh yeah so going back to this whol",
    "rlier I appreciate that which was great it's a inside joke but uh uh yeah so going back to this whole story story of uh I got confused right now because you know we're both in a different place I'm thinking number seven I'm thinking eight and a half I'm in a whole different place today okay well working out is good staying in shape is good you know all that stuff is a very good thing so really don't want to talk to your lawyers why why did you why did they put you in jail I mean I know it's Guil",
    "'t want to talk to your lawyers why why did you why did they put you in jail I mean I know it's Guilty By Association can they even do that like what is the crime every story all the girls it's only towards Andrew where are you involved yeah well when digging through Andrew's entire past trying to find a reason to put him in jail what you have to understand is we have not been accused by X number of women the prosecutor has accused of us of doing X to X number of women these women actually defen",
    "of women the prosecutor has accused of us of doing X to X number of women these women actually defend us actively one of the statements in the file is a girl who I used to date a little bit she details nothing illegal says nothing illegal went on she wasn't held against her will she wasn't trafficked she wasn't exploited but because I used to sleep with her I guess I'm guilty too so I mean I guess one of the girls is my ex so that's the only real link um with me but yeah it's Guilty By Associati",
    " one of the girls is my ex so that's the only real link um with me but yeah it's Guilty By Association they wanted the Tate Brothers in jail so when they came when they came to arrest did they come to was it was it you and Andrew it was both of you yeah they had arrest warrants for both of us and when they came to arrest us what's very funny is my cousin's girlfriend was here at the time with with her friend there were actually women in the house at the time the women in the house were not quest",
    " her friend there were actually women in the house at the time the women in the house were not questioned the women in the house were not asked if they were okay the women in the house were not asked if they were in danger if they were safe they were completely left alone left to sit on the couch with us um while the police watched over us well they went through the house and took everything that was valuable they were Googling the value of the various items they were taking marking it down on a",
    "was valuable they were Googling the value of the various items they were taking marking it down on a spreadsheet and they left I think without saying a single word to the women who were in this house which is very unusual you would think an investigation about human trafficking but you know you could you could take what implications from there you will and guess what their motivation were if you will but I'm I can't say anything at the moment that makes sense so uh we talked to Andrew earlier ab",
    "ill but I'm I can't say anything at the moment that makes sense so uh we talked to Andrew earlier about his experience in jail how was the experience for you from your point of view ah well I mean Romania spends less money per prisoner than any single country in the European Union the the prisons are constantly getting in trouble from the European Union for being uh underfunded uh too many people per room not enough square meters not enough calories per day so the jail experience it wasn't good ",
    "per room not enough square meters not enough calories per day so the jail experience it wasn't good but it was interesting and I took jail on a very strange way I feel like if you're gonna if you're gonna walk around the world running your mouth all the time about what you are and what you think you are eventually something's going to come along in the world and test you if you walk around saying I'm the baddest man on the planet I can beat anyone up on Earth one day something in the street is g",
    "I'm the baddest man on the planet I can beat anyone up on Earth one day something in the street is gonna be like ah you're the guy who thinks he can beat anyone up and punch your lights out you know I don't speak as much as Andrew but I do say I'm a very strong-minded person I always preach to young men if you're going through hardships you know you need to deal with it like a man continue your training stay focused and it just felt like God gave me an opportunity to prove to to myself above all",
    "aining stay focused and it just felt like God gave me an opportunity to prove to to myself above all else as well as to everyone else who listens to me that I am actually what I say I am so coming out of jail I'm almost grateful for the experience as hellish as the environment was as hellish as the environment was you were grateful for yeah I'm grateful that my life has been very very easy for the last six or seven years I retired from professional fighting when I was 28. the last sad thing that",
    " last six or seven years I retired from professional fighting when I was 28. the last sad thing that I guess happened to me was my father passing when I was 26 and a half so I'm 34 now I'm coming up 35. these things happened a very long time ago I've increased in wealth I've increased in Fame I fly around the world doing whatever I like driving whatever car I like staying wherever I like sleeping wherever I like going you know it's been such an amazing experience that I haven't tested myself for",
    "wherever I like going you know it's been such an amazing experience that I haven't tested myself for real in a very long time so yeah grateful for the experience and you had very high praise about you right I mean we did a whole segment about he always thought you were the best brother in the world but after being in jail with you now he knows he's confirmed and reaffirmed that you're the best brother in the world and he almost kind of compared you to like being the the Ying to his yang right an",
    "ther in the world and he almost kind of compared you to like being the the Ying to his yang right and I didn't really fully understand who Teresa was we've sat with Andrew for hours on end we just had 45 seconds with you yeah after that uh paella incident right um but he says that your special gift is the mat you've mastered the art of not giving a [__] yeah what is that all about well I'd say it's not not giving a [__] in the way that because I know people who don't give a [__] their life sucks",
    "s not not giving a [__] in the way that because I know people who don't give a [__] their life sucks you know they don't work out they don't care about their their own health happiness wealth work uh not in a degenerate I'm a bum kind of way I'll give you a better example because I know exactly what he means I feel like because I am his younger brother every great General who sits at a table with his staff needs that one Fearless guy with him you know he needs people who preach prudence and bein",
    "his staff needs that one Fearless guy with him you know he needs people who preach prudence and being careful and we have those people believe me they're very very loud in our ears every single day since getting out of jail but you know if you're a great Samurai General and you're sitting around the table you also need that one guy who says okay there's ten thousand of them there's five of us okay let's just go it's more fearlessness than than not giving a [__] if I if I had played things my way",
    " let's just go it's more fearlessness than than not giving a [__] if I if I had played things my way since getting out of jail me and Andrew would probably be back in jail right now I'm censoring myself on this podcast but the first day I got out I thought you know what screw it and just put a camera on just tell the whole world what's going on let them take me away live on stream that's me so luckily he keeps me in check but also I feel like I can Inspire him to make a few Bolder and braver dec",
    "kily he keeps me in check but also I feel like I can Inspire him to make a few Bolder and braver decisions in life because of my counsel so I'm very much one of his councilmen but he does need me at the table without that guy you're just going to be a [__] you know have you always played the number two role like you know in in monarchical times it was always the eldest son that the pet was passed down to the crown from your father down to Andrew to you has it always been an understanding all rig",
    "down to the crown from your father down to Andrew to you has it always been an understanding all right I'm Number Two my brother's the leader let me get in line let's crush it you know what I I don't feel it's necessarily it's necessarily like that I feel it's more that I know what his strengths are and I'm there to compensate for his weaknesses he knows what my strengths are and I'm there to compensate for his weaknesses so who's the leader and who's not all depends on the situation that we're ",
    "ensate for his weaknesses so who's the leader and who's not all depends on the situation that we're in um certainly with I mean me and Andrew have been a team a very long time and we made a lot of money before we ever blew up on the internet uh our relationship was a lot more equal then but Andrew is the famous one I'm fully I'm fully aware that he's the guy who will go in front of the camera and say the types of things or voice his opinions in a way that Garner infamy uh and fame and I've blown",
    "say the types of things or voice his opinions in a way that Garner infamy uh and fame and I've blown up alongside it so you know part of the prices is going to jail you know they say that uh your ego is not your Amigo there must be some part of you I mean you're a six foot four badass good looking Hollywood looking guy girls Bugattis yet you're you're willing to take a step back seat to Andrew's Fame so you must you must have a big ego to be the place that you're in but you also have to have tic",
    "ame so you must you must have a big ego to be the place that you're in but you also have to have tickets step back and say all right Andrew you're the guy how do you grow up with that well yeah with what we're doing now Andrew's certainly the face of it but he wanted to build this this was never my intention I thought okay you're gonna make some money on the internet that's cool Andrew you do that I'll continue doing what in fact I'm going to interject with another story there was a time when me",
    " I'll continue doing what in fact I'm going to interject with another story there was a time when me and Andrew could barely pay the rent he was training and he was fighting full-time he was a kickboxing one-time world champion I think at the time and I was selling Windows I'm a great salesman so I was bringing home a thousand plus British pounds per week he didn't tell you this story did he no he said there was a window yeah but he didn't say he was balling out making a thousand no I mean that'",
    " said there was a window yeah but he didn't say he was balling out making a thousand no I mean that's not bowling out like I think these three glasses of whiskey cost about a thousand dollars but I was making about a thousand a thousand British pounds a week uh Andrew had a previous sales experience I was at the time working in sales and Andrew was just living off his fight money so I would come home every day I said oh I made this much sales Etc I'll pay the rent you keep fighting because I was",
    "ome every day I said oh I made this much sales Etc I'll pay the rent you keep fighting because I was helping to support his kickboxing career one day Andrew looks at me and he says you know Tristan I'm just gonna start selling for the same company you're selling for we could bring two three thousand dollars into the house a week we'll have a good life we'll make money and I said Andrew no you can't you can't do that because if you are spending all your time chasing sales leads and knocking on pe",
    "t you can't do that because if you are spending all your time chasing sales leads and knocking on people's doors like I am then you're never going to find the time to discover something better to discover something that's going to take us out of this crappy apartment it's going to take us out of this crappy life so even back then when I was willing to work away selling Windows instead of kickbox because I got paid almost nothing I was the European champion at the my height my most I've ever got ",
    "ecause I got paid almost nothing I was the European champion at the my height my most I've ever got paid was a thousand bucks a fight I knew that wasn't the financial viable uh option for financially viable option for me I was willing to sell Windows to let Andrew continue to have time to train but also have time to think so now everyone's like oh well he's the face of this online Persona and you know you guys make a lot of money for it I'm like I'm fine behind the scenes I'm perfectly perfectly",
    "know you guys make a lot of money for it I'm like I'm fine behind the scenes I'm perfectly perfectly happy I'm not missing anything from my life with my 2 million Twitter followers I need 6.8 million to fulfill you know people will often try to I guess pit me against Andrew which is the stupidest idea in the world but they'll say stupid things to me like your brother's more famous than you and I'll say yeah my brother's more famous than you like what's the big deal if your brother was or Mike Ty",
    "l say yeah my brother's more famous than you like what's the big deal if your brother was or Mike Tyson for example and someone said your brother's bare boxing you you'd be like yeah my brother's Mike Tyson what you know it's this strange type of jealousy in envy that I think a lot of men can't cope with that makes them drag each other down like crabs in a bucket if my brother became the I don't know a billionaire the world's richest man and I had to stay at this level I'd be like yeah my brothe",
    "now a billionaire the world's richest man and I had to stay at this level I'd be like yeah my brother's the world's richest man I'd be proud of him and I don't see anything wrong with that it's not a competition we're a team I think that's a big thing so I got an 11 year old son and a nine-year-old son okay and the perspective to have there's got to be a also a massive level of maturity of the younger one towards the older one I'm the younger sibling in my family my sister's six years older well",
    "nger one towards the older one I'm the younger sibling in my family my sister's six years older well we got a very good relationship in our family but the wisdom of the younger is different than the wisdom of the older right you're more watching you're more like okay yeah that's probably not a good idea I saw that smack him upside that I shouldn't do that okay wow that's pretty good that leads to good praise or that that's good yeah I don't like that I have no interest in that okay I would have ",
    "good praise or that that's good yeah I don't like that I have no interest in that okay I would have probably done it this way but I get it so you have a different optic right to see different things at what point was it when you're you know you're coming up and you you guys are you were talking outside and you're like Hey we're so competitive that hey six years ago the whole prank concept but we no longer do pranks all this gun yeah we're a big prank family ourselves when was it and even maybe f",
    "o longer do pranks all this gun yeah we're a big prank family ourselves when was it and even maybe from your pops did that drive you guys to compete against each other or that the Dr did that drive you guys to compete against the world what was his selling point to the two of you I I don't think it's something that we learned from my father okay my father didn't have a a brother or or another guy in his life who were close like me and Andrew I think it's something that happened organically and i",
    "in his life who were close like me and Andrew I think it's something that happened organically and it's not so much competition against each other in terms of what I can do and he can it's more like how much am I going to contribute to the team that you don't so a perfect example this house is set up literally perfect perfect for it I'll come down in the morning 7am Andrew's ass laptop we'll go do there's an exercise we hate doing you put 30 kilograms on a burpee bar do the on a weight bar you d",
    " there's an exercise we hate doing you put 30 kilograms on a burpee bar do the on a weight bar you do a burpee lift above your head and you do 150 times it's tiring it's horrible so I'll do them and I'll say you know Andrew you're a [__] why haven't you done it yet then he'll do them and then I'll go do them again just because I know of I do him he has to do it that's not people could see it as two men competing against each other or you can see it as two men within the same house getting strong",
    "o men competing against each other or you can see it as two men within the same house getting stronger and pushing each other to become stronger you know when we're racing around race tracks we're both I mean I guess professionally trained drivers we have lost track experience lots of Road experience the fact that he will drive faster than me will inspire me to do better in myself then me and my brother as a team are better drivers it's not too many competing against each other you know it's us ",
    "rother as a team are better drivers it's not too many competing against each other you know it's us against the world but that's something that happened very organically and he's always been the better kickboxer you know I'm I'm bigger uh by I mean maybe I'm probably fatter love certainly got more muscle as well but um people see me Smash the pads and you know amateurs like a girl I knew once said oh wow you hit the pad so hard can you beat Andrew in a fight I'm like no no when I try to punch An",
    " oh wow you hit the pad so hard can you beat Andrew in a fight I'm like no no when I try to punch Andrew like I punch nothing I hit I hit air and he ends up counterpunching so he's always been the better kickboxer but I can take that and be like you know what good he's the four-time world champion good that's my brother and just be proud it's us against the world so that wasn't that wasn't Pops that was more you guys it wasn't it wasn't my anything my father naturally instilled I mean he certain",
    "at was more you guys it wasn't it wasn't my anything my father naturally instilled I mean he certainly wouldn't let us fight and argue with each other he had some unconventional punishments we were ever arguing he'd lock us in a Cupboard together to sit there and stare at each other he told us that story he told you that story there we go that way that way you know it's true when you're sitting staring at your brother because you guys were acting up and fighting or whatever you might want to imp",
    "aring at your brother because you guys were acting up and fighting or whatever you might want to implement this for Dylan and Tico do it it works you're staring at each other yes what did you learn about your brother at that point what do you think he learned about you just sitting staring for hours on end as a punishment I think you just realize that the conflict has no benefit you're gonna end up standing in that cupboard that's the payoff for your conflict there's no Victory competing against",
    "p standing in that cupboard that's the payoff for your conflict there's no Victory competing against your brother and um you know we grew up in Luton as a huge Asian a huge Asian diaspora I guess lots of Indians lots of pakistanis lots of Sikhs lots of Muslims and these people work as a team it's the one of the reasons they outcompete British people native British people and almost every single metric and we knew a guy named Bali although I hope Andrew hasn't told you this no so he had a he was ",
    "tric and we knew a guy named Bali although I hope Andrew hasn't told you this no so he had a he was a lawyer probably 50 000 pounds a year and he drove a four hundred thousand dollar Ferrari I thought 400 000 pound Ferrari and a 500 000 pound Rolls Royce sometimes and we were saying like do you think bali's a drug dealer what do you think he's up to it me and Andrew at the time you know had quite a close Brotherhood and he looked at us one and I said Bali how do you have all this money how do yo",
    "a close Brotherhood and he looked at us one and I said Bali how do you have all this money how do you get these fancy cars when you're just a lawyer and you're relatively young he was like 26 27 but five or six years older than I was at the time and bali's exact answer was I remember he said you white people are stupid now I'm mixed race he wasn't talking anything racial he was talking about I guess native British people he says you will have five Sons or your father may have five Sons which for",
    "ss native British people he says you will have five Sons or your father may have five Sons which for someone in my culture he was a Sikh an Indian Sikh from Punjab he said that's a jackpot and this English man's five Sons will all move out of the family home they'll pay five rents probably to people like me they'll take five different student debts out go on five different career paths they'll they'll they'll set up they'll get five different mortgages marry five different women and never see ea",
    "y'll they'll set up they'll get five different mortgages marry five different women and never see each other again ECC my father had five songs now I'm a lawyer my my brother's a dentist my father's an engineer my other brother owns a construction company one of the and every single skill set that they needed to to flourish was within the household so we all live in the family home we pool our resources our women work together and prepare food for us we work uh and every time that we have uh new",
    "ources our women work together and prepare food for us we work uh and every time that we have uh new children or the families expanded we just expand the house my brother owns a construction company and that in that way as a group we have three Toyotas one Ferrari and one Rolls Royce and we can all use them anytime we like and that was what introduced me and Andrew because we were flat broke at the time we had nothing to share uh to the idea of certainly you know what if we can buy a Supercar to",
    "e time we had nothing to share uh to the idea of certainly you know what if we can buy a Supercar together one nice car then we can just share that car and now thanks to his car addiction we have I don't know 40 plus minus the 10 or 11 that means temporarily seized by the remaining government but um yeah it introduced us I guess to the concept of pooling your resources and sharing and you know what he's 100 right that is a lesson you can learn from the Indians from the pakistanis because it's be",
    "t he's 100 right that is a lesson you can learn from the Indians from the pakistanis because it's benefited us massive and you guys live together here in this amazing compound and Andrew said he's foresees himself living with you the rest of his days yeah how much of a factor was those stories from the Punjab guys to today in Romania you know what that was massive and I don't speak to Bali anymore so if you're out there Bali yeah you're listening you know thank you for that um but you know peopl",
    " so if you're out there Bali yeah you're listening you know thank you for that um but you know people people will even ask that nowadays the way that you know when you're a high net worth individual the way things are owned is very tricky you know you don't want you know no high net worth individual has everything in his name let's just put it that way and it's complicated the way things around so sometimes people will ask me there'll be five cars on the drive and you know girls especially who a",
    " sometimes people will ask me there'll be five cars on the drive and you know girls especially who are naive to these things be like which ones are yours and which ones are Andrews my honest answer is I don't actually know let me I have to look at the papers to work out exactly what but it but it doesn't matter it doesn't matter the keys are in this box in that group and we can drive them whenever we like and we never argue because there's so many you know and when you build that abundance and y",
    " we like and we never argue because there's so many you know and when you build that abundance and you build yourself to the level of wealth me and Andrew are what are we going to argue about there were times when we were kickboxing but we didn't have money for food we used to eat cans of sardines and there have been times spitting our last can over plain rice so now people be like oh that's weird that you share a house with your brother I'm like it's weird that you don't you know I used to shar",
    " that you share a house with your brother I'm like it's weird that you don't you know I used to share my last can of food with him and now we can't live in the same house I've got nine bedrooms it's not like we're cramped for space and uh otherwise we just live in two separate houses with four and a half bedrooms each and we'll drive to each other's houses every day it wouldn't make sense there's got to be 100 trust for this to work oh 100 which is what you guys have but me and Andrew have a 100",
    "got to be 100 trust for this to work oh 100 which is what you guys have but me and Andrew have a 100 very obvious yeah very obvious so he he gave you some love what would you say about him like from your perspective you know what what strengths who is Andrew to you and maybe what are some strengths and things he does that the rest of the world doesn't see that you know and Andrew is the hardest working man I've ever met even with the lifestyle he lives now and as fun as it looks and it is fun an",
    "rking man I've ever met even with the lifestyle he lives now and as fun as it looks and it is fun and all the fun [__] we do is real even if we are in a luxury hotel in the south of France where you're paying ten thousand dollars per room Andrew will be up at seven o'clock in that hotel gym he'll message me at 8 30. I'll wake up next to God knows who whiskey spilled all over the desk but again that inspires me and to be like emergency meeting in my room emergency meeting you always say that so I",
