    "k that the worst men on Earth are the ones who haven't had enough pain you're supposed to suffer as a man you're born to suffer the whole reason God put men on this planet is to suffer and the best men are the ones who suffered the most I wouldn't be top G if I didn't suffer more than anyone else you're a better man than everyone else if your life was a mess and it was a hardship because you're not what happens to you you are how you react to it and the best men on Earth are men who have had the",

    "ant to listen to her friends I'm not important so if you self-analyze everything then everything happens for the same reason whether no matter what bad thing happens to you including heartbreak it all happens for the same reason for you to analyze and get feedback if you were more important and more successful she was less likely to leave you that's that's the truth the thing about life is you become a better person via feedback you don't ever become a better person via anything else especially ",
    "ome a better person via feedback you don't ever become a better person via anything else especially not practice people say practice makes perfect and that's the biggest mistake because it's not true because I often get asked Andrew how do you speak the way you speak and I say well feed back and they say what well you've practiced right well everyone practices how to talk there's people who' have been alive 30 years longer than me' been practicing to speak longer than I have don't speak the way ",

    "d make sure it doesn't happen again or sit and blame her and pretend it it's nothing to do with you and then wait for it to happen to you again cuz it will that's how life works like feedback I got from jail or my father dying or heartbreak or being stabbed or whatever it is all of these things happen for you to learn from them and everybody in life has these events and everybody in life has these traumas they can learn from but most people are too stupid or too arrogant or too cowardly to sit d",

    "at things that I've done heartbreak sucks and you do have to deal with it and again no when to walk away without begging or humiliating yourself especially especially in this day and age of DMS and messages being recorded and stuff and each heartbreak like with every bad event that happens in life sets an important marker that you eventually look back on on a longer timeline and you see the growth and the self-improvement and maybe the hypothetical scenarios that would have happened had you stay",
    " and the self-improvement and maybe the hypothetical scenarios that would have happened had you stayed with that person or had you not been betrayed by that person and yeah it serves as very important markers on a timeline but it's only once you progress a couple years past that timeline that you could see the knowledge in it unless you do it the wrong way and let it spiral you to a down the toilet of self-destruction in which case then you're like well that's when my life went completely wrong ",
    "t of self-destruction in which case then you're like well that's when my life went completely wrong so no that's when you chose to give up they're two very different things heartbreak is fantastic I wish someone got I wish my heart could still be broken that would be nice well men live for women this is the point men live for women in every single way if women didn't exist on this planet everything about my life would be different I'd have fast cars cuz I like driving but a lot of the things tha",
    "g about my life would be different I'd have fast cars cuz I like driving but a lot of the things that men do a lot of the things we say the way you dress lots of it is about trying to attract women trying to impress women and trying to have women hold you in a high regard cuz if women in general hold you in a high regard then you as a high value man have your pick of the best women on the planet and there isn't a single R red blooded male out there in the world who doesn't like the idea of lots ",

    "t in general he'd say attractive it because it raises the impression people have of of his wife for example so there's not a single man in the world who doesn't live for women in one way or another women teach you a lot about how to get women which is actually quite interesting like they do women teach you a lot about how to get women themselves if you want to piss a woman off ignore her don't insult her just don't reply and you should know that because when did a woman annoy you most she ignore",
    "ult her just don't reply and you should know that because when did a woman annoy you most she ignored you that's that's right so like you can learn so much from them but women are the prize effectively sexual access or access to sexuality has always been a prize for men that effectively had to be earned you had to go to war and get a come back with a Valor star or you had to be a king or something to get access to sexuality so women were the prize up to a certain point and then if you're a high ",
    " to get access to sexuality so women were the prize up to a certain point and then if you're a high value enough man you can say you become the prize blah blah but effectively women are a fantastic mirror and how women treat you tell you a lot about yourself because women are ruthless and if you're not a if you if they don't see value in you or if they don't see value they can extract from you you're invisible to them you know you can go to a nice restaurant with a girl and you can say how many ",
    "'re invisible to them you know you can go to a nice restaurant with a girl and you can say how many men are in here she'll say um three or four and she'll ignore every wayer if they can't get something from you you're invisible so how women treat you in general is a good Mark for how much value you openly exude if they can if they can instantly see value on you they'll talk to you and treat you a certain way people think that beautiful women are really [__] and rude no they're not they're actual",

    "able loves you it means something a man who's incapable loves you it means nothing at all so if you're uh incapable not necessarily important not necessarily financially successful person it doesn't matter what you feel about anything because you could be replaced and nobody gives a [__] so if you truly care about that I guess the lesson is if you truly care about an issue as a man the first thing you should do is you should improve yourself if you have a woman who you truly love instead of buyi",
    " you should do is you should improve yourself if you have a woman who you truly love instead of buying her flowers every day you should improve yourself if you have a town that you truly love instead of I don't know what you would do instead of telling everyone how great it is you should improve yourself and you should start a business in that town so that there's more jobs in that town it doesn't matter what it is self-improvement is the answer to showing your love for anything as a man so when",
