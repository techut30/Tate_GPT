    "do you think do you think women are the property of men no the point I was like why have you said they are because I made a religious point I said that when a man marries a woman the woman's father walks him down the aisle walks her down the aisle and hands her way to the man traditionally that's what it says in the Bible I'm a religious person I believe in God I live in the Muslim so you do think that the woman becomes the men I think she takes his last name I mean let's watch the clip that you",
    " that the woman becomes the men I think she takes his last name I mean let's watch the clip that you said about sure so that we can get it in context so I think my sister is my her husband's property yes when a bride is walking down the aisle to marry the groom the father walks next to her and gives her away true or false absolutely but I've I've been married twice as it turns out and on both occasions I didn't believe that the woman was being handed to me as chattel as property it and perhaps t",
    "sions I didn't believe that the woman was being handed to me as chattel as property it and perhaps the way that that the reason I'm asked that question repeatedly and I'm asked in a loaded way would you rephrase what you said there now what that's that's an interesting point about phrasing the way I would say things before I was famous I have to take personal responsibility and accept right that if I make a video that 500 people see and one percent of them misunderstand it that's not a problem i",
    "f I make a video that 500 people see and one percent of them misunderstand it that's not a problem if I make a video that five million people see and one percent of Vietnam so specifically on that point I think my sister is her husband's property she took his last name she she married him she wanted to join his family she has seen it herself right so she she's still a sovereign individual she's absolutely property means that the husband owns your sister listen my friend if we want to argue about",
    "solutely property means that the husband owns your sister listen my friend if we want to argue about this you need to go back to the Bible to the Quran you need to argue with religious talk about anything in the Bible of Quran that's what it says no no I'm asking you what you think I think that if a woman marries a man and she decides to take his last name that they have different roles and responsibilities within that marriage and I believe that that's not the question she's had I believe the f",
    "sibilities within that marriage and I believe that that's not the question she's had I believe the father I am the father behave like a politician the father hands her to the man right but don't be a politician because I think you're a straight talker right you keep telling me you're straight talk I think my sister is her husband's property do you regret saying it like that I I understand that with my newfound Fame perhaps it could be phrased differently however I still believe that a woman is g",
    "h my newfound Fame perhaps it could be phrased differently however I still believe that a woman is given to the man in marriage that's what I believe yeah but not as property now the property is the word that other people use the question but as a an equal partner in a loving Union that's what marriage actually means it doesn't mean that when you get married the woman is given to you as a bit of Chapel agreed so why say it but that's the way that people ask me the question people say to me they ",
    "hapel agreed so why say it but that's the way that people ask me the question people say to me they asked the question you can't blame people for asking you questions surely if you want to be accountable for what you've said you've got to own your responses don't blame the question I own the response let me ask you a question no and you say something and then say well actually I blame you for I understand peers peers I understand I believe the woman is given to the man I believe she's given away",
    "derstand peers peers I understand I believe the woman is given to the man I believe she's given away by the father I believe she belongs to the man fundamentally right so fundamentally you do believe that a woman becomes a man's property I believe she belongs to the man in marriage correct right I mean see that to me is misogyny and you're entitled to your opinion right but do you want do you not understand why people think it is misogyny I understand why some people can be very offended by what",
    "understand why people think it is misogyny I understand why some people can be very offended by what I say what they do is they take a point like that and they ignore all the other points I make the other way right that's why that's why I've repeatedly asked you about that line to see if you've changed your position but the reality is you haven't it's not about changing positions I'm a full-grown adult and I stick by the things I say and I'm responsible for them which by the way is fine absolute",
    "adult and I stick by the things I say and I'm responsible for them which by the way is fine absolutely so what you did say at the start of this little exchange you said you know I wouldn't maybe say things the same way now that I did before I was famous and yet actually you've doubled down it's exactly the same thing on certain points so that is what you believe that's my point yes I'm trying to work out look I don't know you we've just met right yeah I'm trying to work out who Andrew Tate is an",
    "ork out look I don't know you we've just met right yeah I'm trying to work out who Andrew Tate is and what you actually believe I don't want to twist anything at all then maybe make it very very clear to the camera I believe a woman is given to the man in marriage I believe that I also believe a man has a duty to protect and provide for her I believe a man should lay down his life if something happens or his wife's life is threatened I believe that when women and children first are on the light ",
    "pens or his wife's life is threatened I believe that when women and children first are on the light boat honestly literally buy them as a slave well obviously we're not talking about that we're talking about religious biblical marriage we're talking about something else yeah but I'm a Christian I don't believe that I I I own my wife do you believe your wife was given away to you when she took her last name I believe that there is a process where a father traditionally walks his daughter down the",
    "last name I believe that there is a process where a father traditionally walks his daughter down the aisle and hands his daughter to this man and they stand there and become a union of two loving people in a partnership no there's no ownership involved I didn't say he's not selling her the Father of the Bride isn't selling his daughter no absolutely that's what profit Stephen means she becomes a member of your family I think we're arguing over semantics Monopoly because fundamentally I don't bel",
    "ember of your family I think we're arguing over semantics Monopoly because fundamentally I don't believe a man owns a woman you do well I don't think a man owns any sovereign individual I don't think we live in the world of slavery I don't own any man or any woman right nobody owns when you use phrases like property that's what you imply and so my point again is you're a smart guy right there's no denying that you're a smart you're good talker I've seen a lot of the stuff but when you what what ",
    " denying that you're a smart you're good talker I've seen a lot of the stuff but when you what what I don't think you quite fully understand now I understand when young impressionable people I understand you are not as smart see things like I think my sister is a husband's property yes and you've just reaffirmed that yeah that belief they think that they have the right to own women I understand that very well Pierce which that's why people think you're a misogynist completely I understand all of",
    "at very well Pierce which that's why people think you're a misogynist completely I understand all of this very well which is why when you're saying I was backtracking I'm not I'm generally regret though over the way you phrase this stuff well this is the point I was trying to make the point I'm trying to make is when I was not nearly as famous and I was making long format content I was not sitting there anticipating I've become the most Googled man in the planet and that few seconds can be taken",
    " there anticipating I've become the most Googled man in the planet and that few seconds can be taken out of context that was not my anticipation but it's not what you believed it is what you believe now so what's the difference it's not about it's not you're asking me you're saying that young people who are impressed you said to me look look please honestly I've had time to think about this and I wish I hadn't said it I don't believe that that's one thing actually you've said the opposite you sa",
