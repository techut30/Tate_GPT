    "Tristan I think there's no secret that you're a bit of a ladies man right I've been known to I think me and the rest of the boys in hereit the crew want to Old the secret to how you actually get a good woman I feel like if anyone has the answer it's You Tristan Tate what do you define as a good woman if I would to if you were to ask me Tristan how do you make a good coffee I'd say three scoops black but you might not you might like cappuccinos he might like pumpkin spice latte or something gay n",
    "ck but you might not you might like cappuccinos he might like pumpkin spice latte or something gay no offense bro don't wor my point is what exactly defines a good woman what do you want from her what do you want to do with her you want a woman who's fun you want a woman who you're going to start a family with you want a woman who's not going to gold dig or hustle you I don't know what you want so I can only give my version of the answer what do you look for in a woman then what is a good woman ",
    " I can only give my version of the answer what do you look for in a woman then what is a good woman to you well for lots of years of my life the over the years of my life the definition has certainly changed when I was 23 a good woman was any woman who was 10 out of 10 like personality overlooked all of it didn't really care because at that point I was building my business I was trying to kickbox I wasn't interested in you know having kids or a future or this kind of thing but I think more of a ",
    "I wasn't interested in you know having kids or a future or this kind of thing but I think more of a play yeah exactly I I was and I I've spent my whole life I guess meeting all sorts of various women and that I think gives me the edge to be able to tell who's a good woman and who's not but what I would say the number one factor you want in a woman is is honesty honesty in everybody is the most important thing that you can possibly look for I'm going to give you I'm going to give you example okay",
    "ortant thing that you can possibly look for I'm going to give you I'm going to give you example okay let's say you meet two women one of them has a let me let me try and formulate this example in my head okay one of them has a body count of nine okay she's 25 that's not super high but it's not low either okay I've got a body count of nine I'm 25 and this woman approaches you and she talks to you right and you meet another girl and she tells you her body count is eight but it's actually Four you'",
    "ight and you meet another girl and she tells you her body count is eight but it's actually Four you're better off with the woman who actually has the body count of nine because if the other woman will lie about that what else is she lying about and also how do you know it's really for once someone has displayed to you that they don't want to be honest or that they're willing to package themselves as something that they're not in order to get in your good books that is the ultimate red flag ultim",
    "as something that they're not in order to get in your good books that is the ultimate red flag ultimate red flag above anything else you know if a girl says hey um uh my body counts for I used to be a stripper when I was in university I was trying to make money blah blah blah and you take her at face value then that's at least someone that you could associate with and you could talk to whereas if a girl's body count was really one and she used to be a stripper too but never tells you and you fin",
    "a girl's body count was really one and she used to be a stripper too but never tells you and you find out some other the line that's a worse woman honesty honesty is what you need from women and I think that the key to finding a good woman is having a good [__] detector and my [__] detector is like none other I cannot be lied to so sometimes you like I'll I'll I don't have a new girlfriend for example and I'll be dating a new woman and then people will say like oh she's only with you for the mon",
    "mple and I'll be dating a new woman and then people will say like oh she's only with you for the money I'm like brother I'd know if she was I'd know if she was with me for the money I'd know if she was with me because I'm rich because I meet women like that all all the time who are trying to get with me because I'm rich and I know she's different so yeah you just want to up your [__] detector um you know there are lots of lots of ways you can catch people lying nowadays but look at any sign of d",
    "ou know there are lots of lots of ways you can catch people lying nowadays but look at any sign of dishonesty or any sign of trying to come across as something that you're not as the ultimate red flag because if you discover one bad thing about her oh she said her she said her body count was four but you know and she you know who her exes were for example but then there's a fifth one he said he used to date her and she's like oh Okay I lied it's five it's not five it's 50 you just haven't found ",
    "ed to date her and she's like oh Okay I lied it's five it's not five it's 50 you just haven't found them all you know honesty more to unlock honesty above everything else but at the same time would you say how do I word this for it a man's biggest downfall can also be a woman in a sense that say a man's trying to build his Empire M and now a woman comes along and locks him down and now he's not even bothered about bringing that like building that Empire would you say a woman could also play a bi",
    "en bothered about bringing that like building that Empire would you say a woman could also play a big part in a man's success 100% but just like with uh just like a a kid or a woman or a certain amount of success if that has the ability to to put out your fire then you're not built for it you're not built for it because I've meet I've met women all across my my journey and my my Ascension to to where I am today who would have loved me to just stop working so much and hang out with them all the t",
    "ere I am today who would have loved me to just stop working so much and hang out with them all the time and watch Netflix and maybe marry them what's sad is and I get called misogynistic all the time so I'll say something quite misogynistic I don't give a [__] what's sad is a woman will happily put out your fire and the same type of woman that will put out your fire to make sure that you no longer work so much and you're not as ambitious sometimes doesn't realize that that's what she liked about",
    " work so much and you're not as ambitious sometimes doesn't realize that that's what she liked about you in the first place let's say I met a woman now let's say she's obviously attracted to the fact that I'm super ambitious that I train super hard that I wake up a seven every morning that I'm constantly trying to learn something and better myself now I'm taking Russian lessons but whatever it is I'm constantly trying to improve Pro who I am women will find that incredibly attractive and still g",
    "I'm constantly trying to improve Pro who I am women will find that incredibly attractive and still get with me and try to put the fire out and try to stop me from doing those things and you know what would happen if I became fat stopped learning stopped making so much money became boring became just stayed at home with her all the time she'd probably end up cheating on me because that's just the nature of people so yeah if you let that happen to you it's your fault there's nothing I could say to",
    "ature of people so yeah if you let that happen to you it's your fault there's nothing I could say to people who you know will meet a woman and and quit the the Quest for greatness Maybe maybe your quest is just to be with your average chick and be an average man and have your average income and have your average family and let them work in the car washes I'll drive past in my bagatti it's fine by me and and there's nothing you can do to drag these people up I try my best to say things like this ",
    "me and and there's nothing you can do to drag these people up I try my best to say things like this and let people listen to me but you know when I get those super chats online hey man I just broke with up with my girl after eight years I haven't been working on myself because I was so comfortable with her and now I'm 41 I'm like bro it's over yeah move on your mistake it's over get your [__] in gear or or or don't don't send me your money on Super Chat I don't need your five bucks like do somet",
    "ear or or or don't don't send me your money on Super Chat I don't need your five bucks like do something else just to say something stupid yeah exactly yeah crazy guys I was going to say Tristan can't remember what I was going to say um no problem I I've been told I'm intimidating sometimes don't wor about it uh she had a point in the my bad something about women you can ask me about women I've I've met more women than most people it was about women to be fair but I can't remember what exactly w",
