    "God hates fat people. Basically if you give somebody a present and they don't look after it, you're going to think of them as an ungrateful, nasty, horrible. You're just going to look at them and think, why did I give that to you? If you give someone a Ferrari and they treat it like shit, they don't wash it, they don't clean it, they don't service it, why would you give them anything else ever? That's why God doesn't like fat people because He gave them a body and they abused it. They didn't tak",
    "at's why God doesn't like fat people because He gave them a body and they abused it. They didn't take care of it, they wasted it. Which means that He has made fat people permanently and continuously and never endingly unlucky. I've noticed this about fat people. They're unlucky all the time. That's basically because God is saying, ah, still fat now. Taking their chances away, plucking it from them in real time. I think that I should try my very best to follow in God's footsteps.

There's no reason to be fat, you don't have to be fat. There's lots of disabilities that people are born with that they can't help. I've got some friends who are black. They're awful. But if you're fat, you weren't born that way. You decided it's okay to be that way. You're saying to God, thanks for the body, I'm not taking care of it. So He's going to ma",

Everyone knows that hot chick who's just out and traveling the whole world and she's going to all these real dangerous third world shit holes like London. And you're like, London's so dangerous, is it ever happened to you there? No, I had a great time in London just strolling around. Because she looks aft",

Richest fuck. You're gorgeous. But ugly people, fat people, God doesn't. You know? They're very unlucky. Which means that I don't really want to talk to them. I don't want to talk to unlucky people.

I'm making this video right now because I just finished having lunch. A business lunch here in Dubai, on the palm. And the guy who turned up was fat. And when he was sitting there he was talking about his ideas. I'm thinking, I bet the roof collapses. How often do the roof collapses in Dubai? But the roof collapses and it murders thi",

So why am I sitting next to it? Why am I listening to this guy? He can't even stop eating. You're going to tell me about business. Because you can't control your own hand putting a donut in your own mouth. Fuck off. I don't want to be on a boat with a fat person. They're unlucky. I don't want to be in a plane with a fat person.

You know? Why did the plane crash? Oh, it was a miracle. The sunlight hit the windscreen in just the right angle to cause a magnifying glass sun ray beam which burnt through the only wire in the cockpit which was exposed in the entire plane crash.

Fat people, they sit there around me sometimes. Like by accident they sit there and I was like, why are you fat? They get so offended. What? What? Why are you fat? I'm just asking why you're fat. You could stop. Why didn't you stop being fat? I don't know why you're not allowed to ask that question. If everyone asked the f",

That's why women hate fat guys because they know you're unlucky. Bitches don't like unlucky dudes either. Women always cry when you're asked by the fat.

Everyone has a meal. We all eat our meal and they eat like a little bit. Make a foot down. As soon as they leave the meeting, of course they get into the car, open up the emergency donut rations.
