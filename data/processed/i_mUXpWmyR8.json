    "ng up and he's happy without money well I think I've written books on money done lot of exploration I actually think the rhetoric that money doesn't make you happy and life isn't all about money is part of the propaganda of what you call the Matrix in indoctrinating us to concede and and just enough so that we can pay our 50% taxes and pay our interest on all our loans and then when we die pay 40% of everything that we own cuzz if we know that money makes us really happy we'll go and find it whi",
    " of everything that we own cuzz if we know that money makes us really happy we'll go and find it which means becoming an entrepreneur and getting out of the system and then that is freedom oh absolutely so I think the smartest thing the rich people ever did was convince the broke people that money was I think that's nail nail on the head all the rich people like don't worry guys don't worry money doesn't make you happy guys I'm going to keep mine but don't worry it doesn't make you have out prom",
    "doesn't make you happy guys I'm going to keep mine but don't worry it doesn't make you have out promise I promise I'm sad promise you're sad yeah we're both are good luck biggest scam alive cuz money is freedom it's freedom to drive what you want eat where you want go where you want it's freedom to sleep with who you want I just described it you want a beautiful woman you need money like to to money is freedom if you if you don't want to be a slave which is it's freedom to say none of money is f",
    "ey is freedom if you if you don't want to be a slave which is it's freedom to say none of money is freedom to say n it's freedom to talk the truth online and be put in jail and come out and still have super cars my man is a Ferrari okay I wish I had a Ferrari okay they don't sit there and go for an hour how did he get a Ferrari it doesn't cross that that part is the part they don't want to do right they just go he's a Ferrari wish I had a Ferrari and they go back to TV yeah and that's why they l",
    "t they just go he's a Ferrari wish I had a Ferrari and they go back to TV yeah and that's why they lose there's a lot of men who think what I think they can't say it they lose their jobs so you want to say money doesn't buy happiness well then you're saying you're happy to be a slave cuz only money is going to give you Freedom when they want to try and attack you let they've attacked me they take your money away on purpose so absolutely money's freedom to have an opinion now so it's true so you'",
    "your money away on purpose so absolutely money's freedom to have an opinion now so it's true so you're yeah exactly so so money absolutely is happiness because freedom is a bare minimum requisite to happiness unless you're happy being a slave and you're right about what rich people did they tried to convince all the people at the bottom that money isn't the answer you're never going to be more happy poor you may as well you may as well be rich I can't think of many scenarios where being rich was",
    "py poor you may as well you may as well be rich I can't think of many scenarios where being rich was a detriment over being poor there's no not many even if money can't help you you may as well have it right so I completely agree with you I think money is a bare minimum requirement for happiness especially if you're a masculine man who wants to out compete then you need money because money is basically everything I think money is the most important thing in the world is health because you have n",
    "cally everything I think money is the most important thing in the world is health because you have nothing if you're dying second thing is is family and friends who you love and the third is money because it's everything else I think everybody knows that the system and the path they lay out for you is not a path that's going to lead to where you want to be and I didn't know what the other path was but that intrinsic distrust for the system and that distrust for the things they wanted me to do ma",
    " but that intrinsic distrust for the system and that distrust for the things they wanted me to do made me search for other avenues and then I found them right and if you speak to the people who are richest if you speak to the people you know this is for everyone at home as well if you speak to the people you know who have the most money and go up to him and say hey what made you rich none of them say school do any of them say school made me Rich I got an A and gcsc like who gives it's it's [__] ",
    "say school do any of them say school made me Rich I got an A and gcsc like who gives it's it's [__] right so it's all indoctrination so I I knew it was indoctrination and for that reason I was always searching if you're searching you're going to find when I was 15 my first job was carrying boxes of fish from 7:00 a.m. till 5:00 p.m. and I would run to work so I'd leave the house at 600 I'd run an hour I'd get there at 700 I'd finish work at 5:00 and then I'd run from there to the fight gym get t",
    "hour I'd get there at 700 I'd finish work at 5:00 and then I'd run from there to the fight gym get to the fight gym I'd get there early before training started I'd eat food next to the gym and then I'd train and then I would get a ride home from my girlfriend at the time so my entire life was 17 hours a day of just running and working and carrying boxes and fighting and I can't be more thankful you know I don't want want to be arrogant but I'm going to I really do believe I've had a perfect life",
    "u know I don't want want to be arrogant but I'm going to I really do believe I've had a perfect life now I don't know if that's actually because I have the perfect life or if I framed it that way but I am so thankful for everything I am so glad I got to grow up poor because I wouldn't appreciate money if I didn't and I'm so glad I got to spend my 20s my that decade where you're as powerful as possible fighting and I'm so glad I've had difficult jobs and no money and I'm so glad I couldn't pay my",
    "ible fighting and I'm so glad I've had difficult jobs and no money and I'm so glad I couldn't pay my bills that I appreciate now all the money I have and I'm so glad I had the parents I had and I'm so glad all these bad things happened to me but enough good things happened and I just really feel like it's been the perfect path and I think back on that job I think back on how my life was back then and I I realized that I wouldn't appreciate any of the things I have now without them there's absolu",
    "and I I realized that I wouldn't appreciate any of the things I have now without them there's absolutely no light without dark the best thing about being rich is talking about how you used to be poor otherwise it's no point being rich at all you may you're not going to enjoy any of it you're going to end up addicted to drugs and doing crazy stuff right the reason I'm so happy I don't drink I don't do drugs I'm happy every day I'm pretty emotionally balanced is because I wake up in a big ass hous",
    " do drugs I'm happy every day I'm pretty emotionally balanced is because I wake up in a big ass house and I realize that I don't have to worry about rent the next day and everything's fine I see it that there is so much money everywhere and even I can't get it all so I want as many people around me as possible to be rich cuz now I'm at least around more money if I if I sent a message inside of hu and said I want to raise $100 million amongst my students themselves I can do it I've got my own Ven",
    "and said I want to raise $100 million amongst my students themselves I can do it I've got my own Venture Capital firm now I was like boom all right 100 million let's buy you all here dish it up thank B done because all of them are making money I want to know as many people with money as possible so if I know a way to teach people how to make money and I'll also make money for teaching them how to make money and I now have people who I can talk to so I have access to the money they make why would",
    "make money and I now have people who I can talk to so I have access to the money they make why would I not teach them how to make money now the reason no one else has really done this is because I don't think anyone else knows how to make money as well as I do and also nobody else can really prepare and build a platform like we have or do the work it takes hu is extremely difficult to launch it's not easy to find 18 professors who know what they're talking about build an online platform need the",
    "not easy to find 18 professors who know what they're talking about build an online platform need the payment gateways and then even when all that's done then you got to find a way to get people to join you got to advertise it I don't have to advertise anything cuz I'm top G everyone knows but it's it's difficult right so we don't even have any competition there's nowhere else on the internet you can go and spend $49 and sit for an entire month learning from 18 millionaires how to make money ther",
    "an go and spend $49 and sit for an entire month learning from 18 millionaires how to make money there's nowhere else on the planet it's the only place so we have no competition so we're we're we're about to conquer the world we're about to conquer the world and that's a good thing but how does one how does one fee their money without getting into hust University well that's I mean if they're watching this podcast is a good thing it's a good start right husters University is the answer from peopl",
    "ing this podcast is a good thing it's a good start right husters University is the answer from people whose minds are already free once your mind is free once you understand that your chance of making money with the traditional loot they've laid out for you is zero going to school going to college going to University getting in debt getting a job with school debt getting a mortgage with Mortgage Debt getting a car with car debt in debt to the banks working at a job with the pay rise comes very s",
    "ebt getting a car with car debt in debt to the banks working at a job with the pay rise comes very sparsely inflation's out of control the property you're never going to pay it off you're never going to get rich you're going to stay broke forever once your mind understands that the system and the path they've told you towards riches which is get a good job get good grades get a mortgage is a lie then you need an alternative which is hust University will teach you how to make money for $49 it cos",
    "hen you need an alternative which is hust University will teach you how to make money for $49 it costs less than lunch we teach you how to make money and you can escape the matrix but first your mind needs to be free you need to understand that the the path they're giving you leads nowhere some people still believe in it bro they do because because uh sorry Mom I'm going to actually say this she's going to watch the podcast later but you know I told her not to take the vaccine I did tell her tha",

    "on have woken up to a lot of the lies but another reason why is because the Matrix didn't betray the older generation as much as it betrayed Our Generation so the path to wealth we just laid out worked for them you could go to school get good grades get a good job get a mortgage get a house pay the house off inflation has made the house price go up you've made a bunch of money so the Matrix did good by you definitely the system wasn't completely corrupted what did we talk about earlier about the",
    "od by you definitely the system wasn't completely corrupted what did we talk about earlier about the cyclical nature of systems when the new king comes in he has good intentions at the beginning changing world right explained that's right the king comes in with good intentions before he ends up lying and lying and lying everyone's intentions start good correct so the Matrix when it was all set up in this mortgage system was probably set up with a very good intention and it worked for a lot of pe",
    "in this mortgage system was probably set up with a very good intention and it worked for a lot of people now it's all a scam but because it worked for your parents they're like oh you should go to school and save up and buy house that's what I did well you did it because the cost of a house was twice your yearly wage and now it's 100 times my yearly wage and it's not even the same game we're playing that's like saying you should just jump jump over him cuz I played Checkers but we're playing che",
    "ng that's like saying you should just jump jump over him cuz I played Checkers but we're playing chess they're different games so the older generation still have some belief in The Matrix but they haven't been deceived they haven't been tricked as badly as the younger generation have this is why they believe in it but and that's why your parents will tell you the path to wealth that they followed because it worked but it doesn't work anymore now we're living in a society where you have basically",
