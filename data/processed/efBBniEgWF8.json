    "atives deep into the caves of idiocy i couldn't believe what's happened in 2020 i've lost all faith in humanity in 2020. i totally understand how the nazis got away with how the nazis got with the with the stuff they did right people always say well why did the german people allow them to do all these things to the well they'll you allow the government to close your business you allow the government to muzzle you you allow the government to control where you can go what time you must be home so ",
    "nt to muzzle you you allow the government to control where you can go what time you must be home so you're no better than them and we're living in the age of information i completely learned a lot about human nature during 2020. i always knew it but it was a very stark reminder that the majority of people they are designed to be led that's what they are they just comply and they're sheep and they follow we talk about the red pill all the time if you watch the movie the matrix morpheus says it mo",

    " this is like the matrix it's come true i lost all faith in humanity this year i cannot believe on what level people will just instantly comply and i'm not big on books but i've read 1984 and in the book 1984 he says people are so reliant on and trusting in the party that they ignore their own eyes they believe what they're told and that's completely and utterly coveted do you see a pandemic have you seen one sick person are there lines outside the hospital exactly if they weren't saying pandemi",
    "you seen one sick person are there lines outside the hospital exactly if they weren't saying pandemic on the news would you know you're in a pandemic no you're just you're ignoring your literal your own vision you deserve a lot of credit because you were in the first guys i was the most aggressive against how stupid and scamming scammy it was a huge scam covered from the get-go from the get-go i took like a few weeks you were like immediate like a scam scam scam scam from the absolute get-go yea",
    "ook like a few weeks you were like immediate like a scam scam scam scam from the absolute get-go yeah cause now most people understand i was right yeah but from the absolute get-go i said i don't buy this there's there's videos of people dropping dead in the street in china and now they got these these movies to keep playing of italy over and over again the italian hospital but then that same movie was appearing in the french hospital i was like okay this is all fake news anyway and i just had t",
    "e was appearing in the french hospital i was like okay this is all fake news anyway and i just had the impression but part of me obviously i couldn't completely and utterly discern whether kobe was dangerous or not at the beginning but i had two basic two basic schools of thought and my basic schools of thought were this if covid only kills one percent of the population and if the symptoms are very similar to flu or pneumonia then there's no way that the chinese or the world health organization ",
    "y similar to flu or pneumonia then there's no way that the chinese or the world health organization would have instantly identified it as a new virus people would have been getting the virus nothing would happen to them the few that died they would have been like okay pneumonia it would have taken a while before they actually realized and identified an individual strain so my logic was okay we're talking about the virus now the virus has probably been around for a year and people have been trave",
    "talking about the virus now the virus has probably been around for a year and people have been traveling masks weren't being worn the world was fully open and it because humans are not nearly as smart or as quick as you think we are right so i decided being tristan sat there and goes there's no way they they instantly identified this virus on the first ever death so this virus must have been around for a while and we've been fine so we're going to continue to be fine that was the first school of",
    "d for a while and we've been fine so we're going to continue to be fine that was the first school of thinking and the second school of thinking is even if it is dangerous it's never going to go away how long does a lockdown last when the lockdown that's what i'd love to ask a liberal when the lockdown's over is kovitt gone or is it still out in the world like nothing changes on any level so if the virus is going to exist forever then i'm going to catch it sooner or later so let's go sweden and [",

    "self i kind of was like whoa okay just me that was there yeah you came along yeah you started saying it me and you were saying it but all the other dudes were just it's only a mask to do so to distill it down our mass for alpha males or beta males master for master master even they're not even beta male is too kind to term because there's two reasons you wear a mask either you're scared of kovid which makes you an idiot or you're not scared of covid you're just scared of the rules knowing you do",
    "hich makes you an idiot or you're not scared of covid you're just scared of the rules knowing you don't need a mask which makes you a coward so you can decide whether you want to be an idiot or a coward every time you put a mask on that's up to you you can make the choice every time you put it on you can flip a coin decide which one you want to be but i'm neither of those things so i will not put a mask on my face yeah [__] yeah now let's back up a little bit so 2020 i mentioned we start off wit",

    " interactions between males and females exactly you're not trying to do anything negative in any regard but they just find it instantly offensive and they find it instantly offensive because they know you're right why else would they be so offended it's a shame the covid thing happened because the covet thing happening stopped that being the biggest deal of of the century man that was going to be big big then covent came but um yeah that was awesome i loved it i loved watching all that and and i",
    "big big then covent came but um yeah that was awesome i loved it i loved watching all that and and i loved what you were saying and i loved your message and your message as controversial as they try and pretend it is really isn't controversial because only 20 or 30 or 40 years ago every woman was taught how to be a good woman by her parents by her mother or father now that they're all failing if you get a woman in the west a lot of the time as a man you have to teach her how to be a woman you kn",
    "ou get a woman in the west a lot of the time as a man you have to teach her how to be a woman you know so men have always taught women how to be women so it's really not that big a deal but they just don't like being reminded of the fact so covertate's in favor of mansplaining yeah oh i'm absolutely in favor of man's plan completely completely like and and i don't want to what am i talking about i want to come across as a sexist i'm i'm a realist and reality is sexist there's no sexist pigs here",

    "t we're talking about you know reality here a little bit of sexism reality sexist nature making them great again talking about the state of american women because you've talked about american culture it's a failed state yeah i for the most part i don't disagree it's [__] up it's pretty bad yeah state of american women corporate so there are good women and bad women everywhere so that's the first thing there are good women here and there's bad women there's good women in bad women everywhere but ",
    "hing there are good women here and there's bad women there's good women in bad women everywhere but we're going to take an average overall as a whole i think that western women are doing something that women in eastern europe and other places in the world don't do and it's a very simple version of it is in most countries in the world if a woman's above 18 she won't be dating a guy she could at least see the possibility of marrying in the future that's that's the basic premise they will date you ",
    "st see the possibility of marrying in the future that's that's the basic premise they will date you if they see that under the correct circumstances if things work out they might end up married to you with children whereas western women just think oh he's funny i'll just [__] him for a few months and yep whatever oh now i have a kid all i'm single mom they don't think ahead they don't think will they will i marry this man they're thinking like netflix and cheetos yeah there's dumb [__] if you wo",
    "hey will i marry this man they're thinking like netflix and cheetos yeah there's dumb [__] if you would ask the average 19 year old american girl who she's going out with would you marry him she's like no then why is he [__] you like why for what now you know so it's a it's just a completely different view on relationships the view is completely skewed and skewed because women have become more masculine in the fact that they believe that them sleeping around or sleeping with a bunch of people is",
    "culine in the fact that they believe that them sleeping around or sleeping with a bunch of people is no different than a man doing it which is obviously completely wrong everyone the brain knows that and it's just it's just a messed up culture it's just messed up in your view this is pretty similar for america canada britain yeah all western countries are the same yeah all western countries are the same because as men are feminized then there's a power vacuum which is naturally absorbed by femal",
    "e same because as men are feminized then there's a power vacuum which is naturally absorbed by females so as men become weaker women become stronger on this is how the the world works right things have to balance out so it's kind of like it sucks but it's natural kind of like it sucks but it's just kind of what it is it's a result of the culture the culture has produced an environment in which men are going to be feminized and that's going to allow females to become more masculine that's what th",
    " are going to be feminized and that's going to allow females to become more masculine that's what the culture has produced that's the scenario we live in that's the rules of the game it's the consequence right there are many countries in the world where we don't have these problems but um we have them here in the west it's just how it works well you say you mentioned a few countries or you don't have these problems where have you you've been to like how many 60 countries 72 72 yeah where have yo",
    "ave these problems where have you you've been to like how many 60 countries 72 72 yeah where have you seen the best woman in the world the most beautiful the most feminine where are they that's a good question and and women are women everywhere right so women are a pain in the ass everywhere this idea that you're going to go to some town somewhere and it's going to be the haven of beautiful girls who know their place i don't believe that's real all beautiful girls know they're beautiful girls so",
    "who know their place i don't believe that's real all beautiful girls know they're beautiful girls so to a degree they're always going to be hard to get etc etc but i do believe that if you get an easter eastern european woman the idea of her looking after you in terms of cleaning the house and cooking for you is zero percent offensive her fat her mother did it for her father her sister does it for her man it's just very normal to them common sense it's common sense right so they have a better un",
    " her man it's just very normal to them common sense it's common sense right so they have a better understanding of gender roles as a whole um so i'd say that anything in south america asia asia i've been to a lot of times but asia is a strange culture to penetrate because many times especially in korea or some or something the girls don't want to be seen with an american man's just really bad look right they want to be with a skank basically yeah you're a hoe yeah right so koreans want to be wit",
    " right they want to be with a skank basically yeah you're a hoe yeah right so koreans want to be with koreans they kind of preserve it the the everyone complains about america being racist it's the asian countries which are the most racist countries in the world they're absolutely racist you can you can move to america from anywhere and as long as you speak perfect english you're american effectively right you can move to japan and speak perfect japanese you are not japanese and you will never b",
    "ely right you can move to japan and speak perfect japanese you are not japanese and you will never be japanese you'll never be viewed as japanese right that's how they are so but in terms of yeah trying to find the best woman if you're looking for a wife i think that yeah eastern europe russia these places are still the place where if you get a girl she's going to have a better understanding of what a woman's job is than in other places in the world but there's a flip side to that and the flip s",
    "at a woman's job is than in other places in the world but there's a flip side to that and the flip side to that is she expects a lot more of you from you as a man right if she's going to do her job as a woman she needs to demand to do his part so an eastern european woman would never ever expect to have to like work a job she'll be no i have a man when i met you in poland i've felt this as being there just just walking around talking to coffee shops and [__] they act like women and they expect y",
    "here just just walking around talking to coffee shops and [__] they act like women and they expect you to act like a [__] man yep absolutely it was it was mind-blowing yeah that's exactly how it should be and you'll often see girls with jobs don't have boyfriends and if a girl gets a boyfriend she'll quit her job so everyone calls them gold diggers but they're not gold diggers like no i have a man now so i have a man so he pays the bills and i look after my man this is how it works right rock sc",
    " now so i have a man so he pays the bills and i look after my man this is how it works right rock science yeah it's like that's just how it works and the idea that they're all gold diggers i actually don't think is true i just think that when they have a genuine view to have a long-term relationship with you why would why would they marry a broke guy well they wouldn't marry a broke guy so they just avoid broke guys all together because that's their whole intention of the relationship in the fir",
    "st avoid broke guys all together because that's their whole intention of the relationship in the first place is marriage so that's just kind of how it works over there you mentioned racism a minute ago talk to me about racism in america obviously it's been a hot issue the past year so what are your thoughts on that is america racist [__] what is it i don't think america is a racist country okay this is a hot topic right is there racism in america on some level there's racism everywhere on some l",
    "is is a hot topic right is there racism in america on some level there's racism everywhere on some level humans are always going to be racist to some degree this is how humans function if i walked down the street and was attacked by a purple man and then i walked down the street two months later was attacked by a purple man when i next walk past the purple man i will be intimidated by said purple man that's not racism that's pattern recognition that's the reason that humans don't try and hug lio",
    "man that's not racism that's pattern recognition that's the reason that humans don't try and hug lions because that we learned a long time ago to recognize patterns hey did you see steve he tried to hug a lion he ain't got a head anymore maybe i should try don't be racist right so this is pattern recognition so people confuse to two and on on many levels certainly all of asia and many countries in the world are far more racist than america will ever be but america's true problem is that they won",
    " the world are far more racist than america will ever be but america's true problem is that they won't shut up about racism do you remember when you were younger i don't know if you ever did this did you ever say to somebody hey why are you angry you seem pissed off why you so angry all the time why are you mad why are you mad you're pissed off and after an hour you're actually pissed off right you make it come true it's the same why are you racist you're racist why are you racist racist racist ",
    "u make it come true it's the same why are you racist you're racist why are you racist racist racist racist racist saying they say words become flesh absolutely that's what it is you just won't shut up about it if if truly you want to end racism then stop discussing color because that's all racism should be removing color i'm half black half white right i don't care what people view me as some people think i'm white some people say brazilian people guess not very often people guess i'm i'm half b",
    "le think i'm white some people say brazilian people guess not very often people guess i'm i'm half black but the point is the only way to truly remove racism is to stop discussing color as a whole stop making quotas for color stop doing all this craziness in the name of fixing racism and just promoting racism but this is done on purpose i'll go full alex jones here but we all know that the elites of the world may need to make sure the people who are getting destroyed by the financial system are ",

    " and conquer this whole racism thing is absolutely and utterly promoted on every single level they want people out there marching the street complaining about racism to distract them from the fact that their job doesn't afford them enough money to ever live a comfortable life ever they want them just to be complaining about something else that's all it is it's this distraction method okay that's all it is the shift gears a little bit let's talk about trump you know trump was not too far up the r",
    "ll it is the shift gears a little bit let's talk about trump you know trump was not too far up the road here maybe an hour or two whatever not even uh he was recent president of the united states obviously you know we talked about this in 2019. what are your thoughts on what happened in 2020 with trump the election all that stuff so i was i was a big trump fan but i i have to admit i have to be completely pragmatic as much as i am a pro-trump guy as much as i'm not democratic in any way i have t",

    "behind that wall that's fine he should have shot it in the head he should have put hillary's ass in jail he should have gone for it but he didn't and and maybe trump knows things we don't know sure i'd actually like to believe that the reason trump conceded so easily is because he knows things we don't know the powers behind the world who allowed it all came and sat down with him and said listen mr trump you can lose this election and go back to mar-a-lago or you can lose this election kick up a",
    "r trump you can lose this election and go back to mar-a-lago or you can lose this election kick up a fuss and end up in jail for one way or another we or worse we're gonna find something we're gonna raid every single property we're gonna destroy your go if you forensically analyze a full grown man's life you're gonna find something right when that's your intention that's what they're going to do you're going to lose all your properties you're going to lose your family legacy you're going to lose",

    "actly what they're doing and and they're going to try and control us one thing is the ego there's another reason why i think this is going to happen is that societies used to be judged on how free they are societies were respected for being free america land of the free home of the braves right so the best countries in the world were free countries the problem is with three countries is that when people start to the problem is we never free country people can think for themselves supposedly righ",
    "people start to the problem is we never free country people can think for themselves supposedly right people can look up things themselves they can have opinions etc so they controlled the narratives very carefully the vietnam war was starting with a lie right they they controlled the narratives and now with the internet they can't control the narratives nearly as easily we can see through the lies without the internet if you were only watching the news you'd still believe in corona like if you ",
    "s without the internet if you were only watching the news you'd still believe in corona like if you were stuck in your house and no internet and watching the news you would really be scared to go outside so they can't control the narratives as easily and that's starting to break down so the idea of a free society is far more scary to them because they can't control people with the manipulation mechanisms they had before so now they have to replace freedom with something else and the only thing y",
    "hanisms they had before so now they have to replace freedom with something else and the only thing you can do to take a man's freedom away the only thing he'll accept as a replacement is safety yeah i'm gonna take all your freedom but you'll be safe don't worry put the mask on stay at home so they're removing freedom from societies and replacing it with safety because they've lost control of the narrative censorship is what happens when the lies don't work anymore and that's why there's censorsh",
    "arrative censorship is what happens when the lies don't work anymore and that's why there's censorship anywhere because the lies aren't working so let's censor them oh [__] the lies are working is basically just the exercise of power of course it is it's suppressed things but if they could lie to us and we believed it they wouldn't need to censor anybody yeah right so censorships when the lies stop working and they're trying to remove freedom from society and replace it with security and they're",

    "lock them up no no don't let them think too much that's what's really happening so i think i think freedom's been removed from society to be replaced with safety and that's uh that's a mechanism of control because that's our only play left now yeah that's the only play left now we opened up this interview talking about 2020 yeah obviously an epic year yeah but a lot of people have a much have a very negative view of it you know they [__] [__] [__] [__] [__] 20 20 sucked oh my god 20 20 is over 2",

    "was afraid it really bothered me it bothered my self-image i was like so that's who i am now and seeds of doubt grow into forests of an action that's what happens right maybe next time it's going down somewhere i'm in the street it's different because it's emotional it's actually much easier to fight in the street than it is in the cage because the street you're mad about something or you have no choice because they attack you but the cage is very premeditated so it's actually scarier you have n",

    "enough in my mind to enter the cage literally after getting drunk and smoked cigars it's almost like a new spin on it for me if that makes sense i've done the train hard and fight thing at the best in the world and now i'm not fighting the best in the world i'm fighting whoever whoever but it's just like yeah if you're about it you're about it i've never said no to any fight in my life and there any professional fight in my life i've never said no to on the street i'm the absolute opposite i rea",
    "ny professional fight in my life i've never said no to on the street i'm the absolute opposite i really try and stay calm and stay out of violence because you never know who you're [__] with right and you never know if they're ready to die so if someone says something on the street i'm very much like sorry my friend sorry okay no problem i'll leave no problems weapons knives yeah yeah yeah you know he might have 20 friends you don't [__] know i'm very apologetic the very the very few incidents i",
    "w he might have 20 friends you don't [__] know i'm very apologetic the very the very few incidents i've had on the street were because i had no choice so you would say you're a nice guy i'm super nice guy i'm not look the morgue is full of [__] egos i ain't going there early so outside of the cage i'm very very apologetic but inside the cage i've never said no to any fight in my life so i had to say yes so that's why i fought because i was afraid so i had to go do it so in your view men should b",
    "ay yes so that's why i fought because i was afraid so i had to go do it so in your view men should be very comfortable with conflict in life physical or otherwise absolutely i think that the the basic tenet of masculinity since the dawn of human time was your ability to fight that was that was all men were for it's all we ever did men were warriors but fighting's not always physical no it's not always physical but you have to but yeah but you have to be comfortable with conflict yeah yeah if you",
