So, my father was a very interesting guy to be around, but there was a endless burden for performance. And it's so interesting to me because I've seen like psycho psychiatrists and psychotherapists and all these other clowns who I don't even believe in. I don't believe in psychiatry.

    "d. So, I'll have all of those things and I'll watch it. If I just do the podcast and don't watch it back, I won't get better. Correct? This is why some people are better at public speaking than others. There are people who cannot public speak like I can. They may be older than I am. They may be 55 years old.

So my father was also very clear with me from the beginning that absolutely everything in life is my fault. Absolutely all of my problems are my own to fix. I don't get to run to anybody else.
