    "Okay, here we are. Welcome to the James Collins Ireland vlog. We're on the wonderful Talbot Street or formerly wonderful. Okay. And I've met this gentleman here. Some might know him. He's Rory Sinnate. He's going to let his story be told now. But of course, cross the way. You meet in these circumstances. It's part of the course these days. A concerned citizen, a good English chap there that's in Dubai. He saw fellas basically his face is messed up. It's nearly like a starfish. I noticed this guy",
    "ubai. He saw fellas basically his face is messed up. It's nearly like a starfish. I noticed this guy as well. Unfortunately, uh it's part for the course in Dublin with the huge levels of violence that's going on at the moment. Rory, how's it going, man? You well? Very well. Very well. Well, obviously until this morning. Yeah. Um you know, it's not nice to see, you know, but um you know, I see the man, he was walking down the road covered in blood, uh no shoes on, and it wasn't really a site I wa",
    "man, he was walking down the road covered in blood, uh no shoes on, and it wasn't really a site I was used to seeing in Dublin itself. It's never really something I've seen in Dublin before this time round. And I only came 3 years ago. Was it 3 years ago? Radical change. I I mean in terms of immigration, asylum seekers and everything else that I'm seeing here and and uh you know users, drug users, in terms of you know crack users, it's increased exponentially. Abs. It's it's rife. It's rife and ",
    " in terms of you know crack users, it's increased exponentially. Abs. It's it's rife. It's rife and it's it's sad to see because I used to walk down this street as a kid and you know there'd be none of that. There'd be absolutely none of it. So to see what Dublin's turning into right now is the phone for me, please. This isn't I'm not covering. I'm talking to this gentleman here. Turn the camera around. No, no, no. I didn't actually. If you look at it here. Yeah. And I'm in I'm in a public place",
    "round. No, no, no. I didn't actually. If you look at it here. Yeah. And I'm in I'm in a public place. So I'm just talking I'm just informing you now. Under section 7 the criminal justice act 2006. I'm able to seize that phone if it has something of evidential value. Okay. Do you understand that? I'm in a public area talking to this gentleman. I think you take a video of that poor man over here. No. No I didn't take but you understand that I can seize that under section 7. Just we'll take a strol",
    ". No I didn't take but you understand that I can seize that under section 7. Just we'll take a stroll down this way anyway. Rory will be here called. So don't be like that. I I didn't I didn't get anything. There we go. We were only just speaking about that there earlier. you know, this sort of totalitarian approach there from the Guardi. We've had it like we're not bothering anyone there whatsoever. You see her approach there? They go for a section seven as if like it's a public order, you know",
    "er. You see her approach there? They go for a section seven as if like it's a public order, you know? I mean, see, I don't I don't know Irish law, so I don't really know what she's talking about. But to say she's going to seize your phone for something as simple as taking a selfie video is, you know, it's threatening behavior from the police. That's not 100%. And we see that actually over in England taking place now when it's in Ireland, you know. So they just think that they can have the boot d",
    "nd taking place now when it's in Ireland, you know. So they just think that they can have the boot down uh you know on Irish people. How dare they? Firstly anyway I'm in a public place so I'm I'm perfectly entitled as we know there's cameras everywhere around the place anyway they're like it's just tying you know it's it's a tyrannical state now and it's almost as if you know if you if you don't comply by what they say you know they're going to seize electronics and make your life difficult you ",
    "omply by what they say you know they're going to seize electronics and make your life difficult you know and start but you have to stand up then as well. I'm just saying we're we're walking away whatever. Yeah. go back in there, do your job. Some other probably a woman that shouldn't actually be in that position, you know. Unfortunately, actually, I've noticed myself personally now that lots of these guards actually that are women are just Yeah, they get highly emotional and uh yeah, and of cour",
    "ese guards actually that are women are just Yeah, they get highly emotional and uh yeah, and of course, you know, their nature is nearly is to be bloody tyrannical straight away. I mean, how dare she get up and how dare she treat me? This is my country. I've got a strong sense of proprietorship. She's actually a civil servant there. She should just be doing her job. Absolutely. I mean, we didn't need bothering. We weren't doing anything wrong. Yeah. We don't want our our serenity invaded. Anyway",
    "eed bothering. We weren't doing anything wrong. Yeah. We don't want our our serenity invaded. Anyway, Rory, we're going to move on to another individual there that you might know. You've got this guy supposedly I mean, he's in a lush enough pad now over in Dubai there. Like, you know, he's tell us a bit about that there, the background and who the individual there that's well known. You're he's good. Yeah, I'm good friends with Andrew Tate and uh yeah, I live in Dubai. um reason for me living in",
    "od. Yeah, I'm good friends with Andrew Tate and uh yeah, I live in Dubai. um reason for me living in Dubai is because uh obviously we don't feel safe, you know, we don't feel safe speaking out online. We don't feel safe uh to put our money in in UK banks. Um we don't feel, you know, as if we can have a voice anywhere else but places like Dubai and things like that. Obviously, we've seen what happened with Andrew. Um the Romanian case is now coming to an end because they can't bring it to trial d",
    "ned with Andrew. Um the Romanian case is now coming to an end because they can't bring it to trial due to lack of evidence. And you know then now the British have took it upon themselves to escalate that and try and extradite him so they could do the job instead. So cuz he's getting so much publicity in the parliament and even in schools they were warning out children all this about toxic masculinity and all this crap like you know when in real when in real life it's just masculinity. There's no",
    "ity and all this crap like you know when in real when in real life it's just masculinity. There's nothing toxic about it. Correct. So that that's the truth. And actually what's the only thing that could be perceived as toxic is the sheer lack of masculinity these days. Yes. And it's poisonous for the youth. You know, you're not allowed to speak about being masculine, but you're allowed to talk about chopping your dick off in school. It's, you know, it's it's crazy. It's poisonous for the for the",
    "ut chopping your dick off in school. It's, you know, it's it's crazy. It's poisonous for the for the next generation. And it's only going to get worse if you continue down this this road of woke wokeism. Yes. And, you know, and, you know, gender gender identification and things like that. Like, you know, they're always coming up with new terminology every time. Anyway, is there 74 genders now these days or is there more? Apparently. So, you know, I personally, you know, I don't care what You cou",
    "e days or is there more? Apparently. So, you know, I personally, you know, I don't care what You could be gay, you could be transexual, you can do whatever you want. Keep it away from children. Yeah, that's my take on and we're again you're a Christian country as well. They're probably trying to change that. But we have heteronormative values. Okay. We were raised up I mean by you know obviously wonderful parents and wonderful this gentleman here has got a bit Irish there. His family are there d",
    "onderful parents and wonderful this gentleman here has got a bit Irish there. His family are there directly Irish. So you know he's coming over here and yeah he's obviously seen radical changes but can obviously juxtapose that with England. And how far I want to ask you there with your experience. How far are we down the road from England? Because of course we're moving on very quickly. But in saying this, funny you say this because I said this yesterday. I said uh you know Ireland is moving lik",
    "ing this, funny you say this because I said this yesterday. I said uh you know Ireland is moving like England England is obviously worse, but Ireland is at a more rapid rate of its downfall. Like England took 20 years to get back. Ireland's going down at a much faster rate than what England was in terms of, you know, in terms of the immigration, in terms of the the locism, in terms of, you know, it's it's it's corruption. Smaller population as well. So, yeah, absolutely. But it's just honestly I",
    "t's it's it's corruption. Smaller population as well. So, yeah, absolutely. But it's just honestly I've never seen such a quick turnaround of a place than I have in Dublin. And that's true. Radical. Radical. Yeah. And it's a shame because I love Dublin. Yeah, of course. Okay. Look at anything else there to wrap things up there, you know, into the future. Are you doing anything? What's happening in Dubai? What's the story? I think you were mentioned there as of we there's some enterprise there in",
    " Dubai? What's the story? I think you were mentioned there as of we there's some enterprise there involved in like lads there that it's mainly is it online? Uh yeah, so we we run an online university called the real world and what we do is we encourage young men to make money online and we teach them. So we have several different campuses. Each campus we have a professor and we have captains as well who the professor speaks to every day and they get the knowledge out to the kids to make money. T",
    "ll who the professor speaks to every day and they get the knowledge out to the kids to make money. There's I think there's 14 different campuses at the minute down from crypto, drop shipping, lots of different ways to make money online and you know avoid maybe your your 9 to5 um you know getting stuck in the in the system of you know paying extortion and tax and getting nowhere in life. So we we try and motivate these young lads to do well and be men there's also a fitness campus in there too. S",
    "ry and motivate these young lads to do well and be men there's also a fitness campus in there too. So very important very important and for only $100 a month I mean you spend more a month so it's absolutely worth it. Yep. And most students, you know, if they're by themselves, they make their money back within the first few few days. So, it's worth the subscription price alone just to, you know, go go you make your money back in the first few days. So, it's it's completely worth it. And um then a",
    " go you make your money back in the first few days. So, it's it's completely worth it. And um then again, you you find that the whole with Dubai, you have a certain level of, you know, attitude there like the the uh the boots, the jack boots at the door. That's right. Yeah. That's right. So, no, you have to surround yourself with like-minded people. You have to keep working hard and you have to keep, you know, speaking out. Keep saying what you believe is true to you and don't worry about what a",
    "ep, you know, speaking out. Keep saying what you believe is true to you and don't worry about what anyone else thinks because uh yeah, that's not going to get anyone anywhere. It's not going to help the world. And most of them are cowardly rats anyway. Like better status as well. They'll back the state no matter what. Like, you know, I think a lot of people are just terrified to speak out because what happens is they shut down your banks. I've had it myself. They, you know, it's a tyrannical sta",
    "what happens is they shut down your banks. I've had it myself. They, you know, it's a tyrannical state. If you don't agree and comply with what they say and what they want you to do, then you're in trouble. And a lot of people, they have mortgages. They're scared of losing their houses. So, you know, it's I I can see why these people are scared, but I think it's important that more people speak up. Absolutely. Yeah. But thankfully, things maybe are are changing a small bit because there are indi",
    ". Absolutely. Yeah. But thankfully, things maybe are are changing a small bit because there are individuals that are putting their head above the parit. They're forming collectives and they seem to be getting a little bit of traction and it's getting a I think more and more goodwill I think more and more people are starting to come to terms with the reality of what's going on because they can see that soon enough maybe that uh a knock on the door mightn't be too far away by something that could ",
    "that soon enough maybe that uh a knock on the door mightn't be too far away by something that could be totally completely inact. It's round the corner for anyone online these days. Absolutely anyone. I've been a victim to that myself, so I know exactly how it feels. Okay, spot on, Rory. I enjoyed that. H I think we're going to leave it at that. You know, support the James Collins Ireland podcast. You can do so there by uh there's a PayPal, there's a buy me a coffee, you can have a look in there ",
    "You can do so there by uh there's a PayPal, there's a buy me a coffee, you can have a look in there to of course what the lads are doing. It seems very interest. I'd say a lot of people there that are subscribers and followers there of the channel are probably aware, but they're already I have to say it was news to me, but it sounds very interesting. I'll tell you what, when I get a moment, I'm going to be checking it out anyway there, you know. So, uh, we actually own university.com. So, if you",
