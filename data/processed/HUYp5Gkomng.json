    "st look at each other like truce like we can't we don't want we don't want to sit and do this thing we had to do so we became a team and then I think it evolved from there because there's always been a hierarchy I am the older brother I'm the bigger brother he does respect me for that we both have opinions but you know it can be it can be vetoed by me in the end and we have our specific roles my specific role is I'm I'm the one who takes the most action I'm the one who over worries I believe esp",

    "n on the internet without seeing my face sure isn't that beautiful they have to all lie to their man and pretend they don't know me oh I don't I don't know him cuz if they go I was with him for a few years their whole relationship would Bo break down because then he's going get pissed off and insecure so that that to a degrees is a victory um that's kind of fun but no I wouldn't I I didn't have any the reason I say heartbreak is because in the modern world I don't think things were as bad when I",
    "y the reason I say heartbreak is because in the modern world I don't think things were as bad when I was younger I don't I think women were more pure when I was younger even in the when I was 20 it's only 16 short years I think women were actually a lot pure before only fans before Instagram the sexual Marketplace wasn't globalized when I was 20 if there was a hot girl in the small town she was the hot girl in the small town now she's the hot girl in the small town she's also in Dubai and coral ",
    "e hot girl in the small town now she's the hot girl in the small town she's also in Dubai and coral and the whole world's globalized the competition's globalized Everything's changed I didn't have a particularly hard time the reason I say heartbreak is because 80% of the emails I get from men are about heartbreak I think that most men especially young men in the world today are getting their hearts broken and when you're saying who are they leaving for they're leaving for the millionaire who hit",

    " to move on I got to move on did that happen or no no I wouldn't say that particularly happened what would what did happen though like I said earlier is when you have experience with lots of different apples you know what a good one in the bad one is so when we say we all had that girl we messed up when we were young if I found another girl with those qualities I certainly wouldn't mess it up you just need you need experience to understand what you have to Value it if you don't have experience y",
    "just need you need experience to understand what you have to Value it if you don't have experience you don't value what you have so the original question is a really good one of whether men are are chained and enslaved by their desires or whether they need to sleep with lots of women I think in the modern world you need experience and you need choices and you need options but if you live by the sword you die by the sword if you're going to be the guy who's also out there in the club and sleeping",
