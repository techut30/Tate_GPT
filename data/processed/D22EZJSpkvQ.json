    " they want to roll in at quarter past n and chat for 15 and look we sound like old FY does right now okay we probably are yeah but some of those values are good sure always do more than you're paid to do and you'll get paid more what happened to that yeah okay however okay now I'm I okay the younger generation they don't they're not going to work for free I get it they're not going to do it they're not going to stay past six some of them will I'm generalizing some of them will well those that do",
    "e not going to stay past six some of them will I'm generalizing some of them will well those that do are going to do well right but it's because their values have changed we grew up with completely different values we grew up thinking if we work hard if we dedicate a lot of our time to other people we will get better raise we will blah blah blah this is expected of us and then we will have a uh more money to buy a house and settle down this is just how life Works they have grown up with a comple",
    "re money to buy a house and settle down this is just how life Works they have grown up with a completely different value system which we think is wrong but actually it's just different they value work life balance like we have never valued work life balance growing up we knew that we had to work hard and work long hours just to get the job and to stay in the job they go I'm going to work 9 till 6 because actually I value my time after work just as much or even more that's fine but they can't get",

    " now like a lot of people are saying I don't want to be promoted I'm happy just where I am getting my my salary because if I get promoted I'll have to work more and I actually then won't be able to do all the other things that I love on the weekend and after after work ET someone who works better smarter harder will just yeah I know totally an inflation will wipe out their salary something needs to change I'm not saying that this is the that this this is sustainable it's I don't feel like it is ",
    "o change I'm not saying that this is the that this this is sustainable it's I don't feel like it is something will need to change because we need hard workers you know we need people's ethics like really to come back yeah yeah yeah like exactly it's not even about the money it's like if I know that I've done a really [__] great job today and it's not just good enough like oh that's good enough I'll go I can never do good enough I needed to go the EXT because it made me feel good it wasn't even a",
