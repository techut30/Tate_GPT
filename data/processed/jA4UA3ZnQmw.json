    "when you're when your mindset changes you start to be extremely accountable for yourself no one's coming to save you you become extremely accountable so when you realize that your word is one of the few things you have on this planet if you say things you're going to start sticking to them so then it becomes very easy to train you say i'm going to train every day this week i'm going to trade for two hours a day as soon as you set it it's basically done if i say something it's basically done it's",

    "ecause i'm the kind of person who sticks to the words he says and this is another thing you'd understand with the g mindset be very very specific with what you say because if you instill your mindset correctly and you start to just say things just start saying things then you hold yourself accountable say things you don't even think you want to do wake up and go up to your friend or your mom or whoever and say you know what i'm gonna do a thousand push-ups today say it to people i'm not gonna sa",

    "cause my retakes all day i said it and if i say something it has to happen this is the fourth tenet and one of the most important ones because that is the power to unlimited motivation and that's the power to be taken seriously across all spheres of your life be specific with your language i was in a restaurant the other day some guy was arguing with his girlfriend they were talking he's like you better be quiet better be quiet kept saying you better be but there's no threat at the end of it i d",
